The Jerdon's Babbler (chrysomma altirostre altirostre) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in Myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether. But a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in Myanmar's central Bago region in May last year, according to their report published in the latest edition of Birding Asia. Re-discovered: The Jerdon's Babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in Burma . The scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along Myanmar's mighty Irrawaddy river, now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast Asian nation. At one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station, the team heard what they thought could be the babbler's call. They then used a recording of a Jerdon's Babbler from the Indian subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself. Frank Rheindt, from the National University of Singapore, told AFP he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey, which was also carried out with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Myanmar's Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division. 'It was unbelievable,' he recalled. 'We played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds. Like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them, they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call.' Further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs. But researchers warned that the bird's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on Myanmar's few remaining grasslands. 'This discovery not only proves that the species still exists in Myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well,' Colin Poole, director of Wildlife Conservation Society's regional hub in Singapore, said in a statement. 'Future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them,' he added. Birds fly over the Moe Yun Gyi Wetlands in Bago Division, Myanmar, where Jerdon's Babbler was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct . Rheindt said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small, 'around 50-80 hectares' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby. He added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in Nepal, India and Pakistan. His team now hope to conduct DNA tests to decide if it is a separate species. Burma's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011. It has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country's generals were. Burma has more species of bird than any other country in mainland Southeast Asia, with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Was last spotted in Burma in 1941,and was thought to have died out .\nScientists used a recording of its distinctive call to rediscover species .\nDiscovery proves bird and habitat both still exist in Myanmar ."}]}

Mal Feebrey, a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when the death row inmate, with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant. Chan, who had been in jail for five years at the time, 'knocked' the Assemblies of God minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said, 'have mine'. Scroll down for video . Mal Feebrey (above left), a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan (above right), with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant . 'It really touched me. Here I am waiting for a donor, I'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going \"my liver's ok, you can have mine\",' Mr Feebrey told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'He was sort of like, if they want to kill me, then you can have my liver. It wasn't a passing-the-time comment, he wanted to make it happen. If he could have pulled it off he would have,' he said. Chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead, determined to save Mr Feebrey, who shared his Christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005. While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend. Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency. Mr Feebrey said that when Chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail's clinic than himself. 'It was a bit surreal. Andrew took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy,' Mr Feebrey said .

The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians . Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency . Mr Feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with Chan, and is an outspoken advocate for the 'I Stand For Mercy Campaign'. The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians, and posted on his Instagram account after the Chan heard of his rejected Clemency appeal. 'Just spent the last half an hour with my friend Andrew Chan, when the Australian Consulate Staff notified him that his final appeal against [the] death sentence was rejected,' Mr Feebrey posted. 'He took it on the chin with courage, humility and with a contrite heart.' In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account. 'The most beautiful people that I've known are those that have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and yet found a way out of these depths,' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with Chan. In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account . The men's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for Chan and Sukumaran, who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners, to be executed. 'Andrew is the idyllic, dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him – they want to put to death?,' Mr Feebrey asked. Both Chan and Sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside Kerobokan prison since 2009. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Earlier on Saturday the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison . Mr Praseyto said the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions.

The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Both GPs and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-British users of the NHS and payment procedures will be made easier. However, the latest Department of Health statistics indicate there is a long way to go. Released following a Freedom of Information request, they show that in 2013/14, British taxpayers handed £749.8million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens abroad. This has risen by £100million from £649.3million just a year before. But in the same period, the NHS managed to collect only £50.3million from European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. This is an increase on the £32million total the year before – but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way. Ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment. Figures which emerged at the weekend show the NHS is still chasing at least £62million of unpaid bills for foreigners’ care. One London hospital trust alone – King’s College – is owed almost £18million from overseas patients. One single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than £420,000. Others owe more than £100,000 for treatments including dialysis, bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, according to The Sunday Times. Health minister Dan Poulter was even photographed with a new mother from Zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a £3,000 bill. Two years ago, cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to Britain for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’. Last night Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: ‘We’re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world. ‘But we are not the International Health Service, it’s the National Health Service. This is an issue which needs to be addressed.’ Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: ‘It is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for EU citizens.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 . Part of the gap is due to the fact that so many British pensioners retire to the continent. There may also be more tourists from Britain travelling to mainland Europe than the other way round. But there are more than a million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other European countries. Under EU arrangements, UK citizens can be treated by other nations’ health services and the bill is sent back to Britain. In theory, these European nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the NHS. In 2013/14, the UK paid Ireland £246million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only £22million came back the other way. Some £250million was paid to Spain but only £3.2million came back. France received £152million but returned just £7million. Italy got £6.2million and sent back £1.1million, while Greece collected £8.9million and returned £400,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We want international visitors to feel welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it – just as families in the UK do through their taxes. ‘Our plans will help recoup up to £500million a year by 2017/18.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Emergency medical treatment is one thing, but taxpayers cannot be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer-term treatment for tourists. ‘Our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors.' Zimbabwean-born Caroline Nyadzyao, who is being chased for £3,000 by the NHS after giving birth in a Norfolk hospital, meets with health minister Daniel Poulter . Smiling alongside a health minister at a Norfolk maternity unit in 2013, this new mum is still being chased for the £3,000 it cost the NHS to help her give birth. Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. The mum said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told the Sunday Times it was ‘unfair ’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled to abuse the NHS benefits, but... I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that?’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Miss Nyadzayo said: ‘I was told because I was 31 weeks’ pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we’d be charged.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hospitals still failing to claw back the cost of treating Europeans on NHS .\nComes as the health tourism gap soars to almost £700million a year .\nUK now pays £15 for healthcare costs for Britons who fall ill abroad .\nBut in return it only receives £1 from foreigners who get NHS treatment .\nPM and Health Secretary have pledge to introduce measures to recoup cost ."}]}

The former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United striker, who started and ended his career at Helsingborg, was speaking at a media day to launch the 2015 Allsvenskan season, with his side kicking off at Kalmar on April 4. Appointed by Helsingborg last November, Golden Boot winner Larsson took over at a club that, although known as a powerhouse in Swedish football, found itself struggling financially. Former Celtic and Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson now manages at his former club side Helsingborg . To arrest the alarming economic slide, Larsson decided the fat wage packets paid by the club would be a thing of the past. With Helsingborg's blessing, he introduced a salary cap reported to be a modest 40,000 Swedish crowns ($4,700) a month -- about half the average wage in the Swedish top flight. 'I won't comment on the sums, but I will say that it's not the wages that Helsingborg used to pay in the past,' Larsson told Reuters. The former Sweden international gets emotional during his last playing appearance for Helsingborg in 2009 . 'I don't mind players earning money, but it should mean at the same time that the club is doing good. 'If the club is doing good, the club is getting income, then the club can share it with the players. But when the situation is not going according to plan, you have to look at the financial bit and see what you can change.' Larsson learned his trade with Helsingborg before traveling the well-worn path taken by Swedish players to the Dutch league, joining Feyenoord before moving to Celtic and winning global recognition, and no shortage of riches, for his scoring feats. Larsson won four Scottish league titles with Celtic and two La Liga titles at Barcelona plus the 2006 Champions League. The 43-year-old finds the back of the net for Sweden in the 2006 World Cup group stage clash with England . Larsson was a prolific scorer for club and country, celebrating against England back in 2006 . He recommended that young Allsvenskan players seeking to emulate his success and that of former Malmo striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic should play to develop their game, rather than their bank account. 'I think that the average wage in Sweden is too high. They won't be financially independent from the money they earn here (Helsingborg). 'They earn good money, but I think there has to be the desire to develop, to go on to a bigger league and earn your money there.' Helsingborg's wage cap might have restricted his options a little but Larsson said the chance to work with one of Europe's great finishers - himself - may have helped attract players. 'It's always difficult, but there are always players that have the desire to do something with their football,' the 43-year-old said. Larsson is a club legend at Celtic, seen here lifting the 2004 SPL title with the club he played at from 1997-04 . 'There are players who tend not to look at the money short-term, they have a bigger plan. I haven't found it that hard to attract good players to the club.' Among the players at his disposal this season is his 17-year-old son Jordan, who signed for the club several months before his father took over as manager. 'When we're at the ground he's a football player like everybody else. Even though he is young I expect him to do what everybody else is doing - I don't make a difference just because he's my son,' Larsson smiled. Having performed the near-miracle of keeping minnows Falkenberg in the Swedish top flight last year, Larsson is looking forward to being back in his home town. 'Everything is possible in football,' he said, not ruling out the possibility of a title run with his new charges. 'But for us the most important thing is to steady the ship and make progress with the team.'

Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen was arrested with Chan and Sukumaran in 2005 for his role in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali and into Australia. In an online campaign to raise funds for a fifth appeal against his life sentence, the 31-year-old describes his anguish for the first time. 'Today as sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians I am terrified,' says Nguyen. 'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' Scroll down for video . Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . 'Agonisingly certain I will be next': Tan Duc Thanh Nguyan has launched an emotional plea for help with a MyCause campaign to raise funds  for his legal costs, and those of fellow Bali Nine prisoners in Indonesia . Nguyen was arrested in Bali as a 22-year-old and sentenced to life in prison. He's now desperately hoping to raise money through his My Cause campaign to pay the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow inmates Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman. 'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' he writes. 'With recent events surrounding my friends Andrew Chan and Myuren Sukumaran on death row I fear that the rest of us will never be able to have a fair trial.' While they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' Funds raised will be used to cover costs for of all three men, and any remaining money will be donated to support legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives. Nguyen says his family, who run a bakery in Brisbane, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are swamped with those debts. He said one of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. 'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says. 'I now know my decision to take part in this crime meant that not only myself suffers but those around me and those who love me. I am a brother, a son, an uncle and someone’s nephew.' The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . Tan Duc Than Nguyen, pictured here with fellow Bali Nine prisoners, says he has spiralled into depression watching events unfold for Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia and is desperate for his own life . Nguyen has been trying to repair his relationship with his family since being convicted almost 10 years ago, and said he is haunted by the memory of his mother coming to visit him for the first time in prison. His parents were given asylum in Australia after fleeing Vietnam and taking refuge in the Philippines, where Nguyen was born. Describing his parents as hard-working and courageous, Nguyen said that he threw away what they fought so hard for and that he will never be able to make it up to them. 'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008. 'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.' 'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.' Nguyen, who is currently being held in a jail in Malang, says he was moved from Kerobokan prison because he needed help. 'I had spiralled into the deepest depression. I hated myself and pushed everyone away. I woke up every day feeling angry that I had woken. Disgusted that I was still alive.' he says. Now, he says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.' The hard line stance of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has frightened Nguyen to the point where he believes he may not receive a fair trial, but he says an appeal is his only chance. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members) Despite international pressure and official protests from the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria, Mr Joko has remained unwavering on the executions. 'No one prefers death. Death is an easy way out. I deserve the suffering I’m going through. But an appeal means hope. Without that hope there isn’t any future,' Nguyen has told the Daily Telegraph. His sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Chan and Sukumaran as they await the outcome of their last-ditch appeal. The appeals were adjourned until next week, and Australian authorities have continued to negotiate with the Indonesian government for clemency and life imprisonment for the pair. High profile Indonesian authorities have reportedly urged President Joko to reconsider the executions, amid concerns that if the executions go ahead the nation's reputation will be tarnished. 'Cracks are showing. They know that after these executions, there are many more to come,' one source, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fairfax. 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next,' Nguyen said of Chan and Sukumaran . Nguyen has  been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal . Nguyen is currently being held in a jail in Malang, where he shares a cell with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens (above) Nguyen has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush (above), whom he enlisted as part of the plot .

He was turned off by the price tag of American-made clothing: basic crew-neck tees starting at $50, unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $250 and up, Oxford cloth button-downs cut and sewn in Los Angeles ranging from $150 to $300. \"It's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing, but it wasn't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point,\" Schnakenberg said. To help shrink the gap, Schnakenberg and his Los Angeles neighbor, Sasha Koehn, started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to \"made in USA\" fashion. Buck Mason has been up and running since late 2013, offering a focused collection of American-made garments. Prices range from $24 for a t-shirt to $155 for its most expensive pair of jeans, about 25% to 50% less than comparable brands boasting the \"made in USA\" label. How do they keep costs down? By focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in Venice, California, they say. With the help of the Internet and social media, they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores. \"It didn't make sense for us to not do it this way,\" Koehn said. \"Maybe that's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager, but I don't see how we could have got this started any other way.\" Brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail, and it's still a big gamble for most. Traditional middlemen such as department stores, chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases. But some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous. By selling directly to consumers, brands increase their margins, control inventory based on their own projections and don't have to worry about returns from retail store customers. They also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers, said Jack W. Plunkett, CEO of market research company Plunkett Research. Fueled by venture capital investors, there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands, and not only in clothing, Plunkett said. But very few actually manufacture in the United States because of the high cost of doing business, especially compared with global competitors. For Buck Mason, manufacturing in the United States is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end, Schnakenberg said. \"It's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch. We may not sell 100 million t-shirts, but we can say we're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process,\" Schnakenberg said. To make direct to consumer work, Buck Mason and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing, taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties. They sell through their own websites and stores, retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising. They build audiences through social media, using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors, forming relationships in the process. But it takes more populating a Web store or Instagram feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins. Brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving, depending on the product and its place in the global market, Plunkett said. \"Overall, this is positive for the sustainability of U.S. manufacturing, but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here,\" he said. Instead of designing various products in different colors and styles, fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right, developing a cult-like following and adding products based on customer feedback. It's a model that has worked for Adele Berne and Mike Kuhle, who launched the e-commerce arm of their New York storefront, Epaulet, in 2008 with a button-down shirt for men and women made in the city. From day one, they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store, using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details. Since then, they have expanded to accessories and footwear, and they offer custom suiting and shirts. Along the way, they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the United States and Europe. They partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker Alden and suit maker Southwick on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale. Through social media, Kuhle says, Epaulet has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand, its creators and its manufacturing partners. Their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the U.S. or Europe, and they keep coming back. \"Your product has to be unique, and it has to be something people want, whether it's filling a void for something people don't know they want yet, or it's something you see in market that you could do better,\" Berne said. Buck Mason launched with a simple T-shirt, working with a knitter in Los Angeles to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city. When it sold out, the company started working on a five-pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from North Carolina and cut and sewn in Los Angeles. It's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full-package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof. The upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows Buck Mason to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround. Chris Sutton started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his Cincinnati, Ohio, workshop. As demand for Noble Denim grew, Sutton and his wife, Abby, scaled up production by partnering with a Tennessee factory that, like most remaining textile manufacturers, had seen better days. As the Suttons learned more about the factory's history and the town it once supported, they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities. It was \"hipster and naive\" of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans, Abby Sutton said, and they started pondering new products. They tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts. After selling out within days, the couple decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new business. Sweatshirts sold under the Victor label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as Noble Denim. Unlike Noble, which is sold in a few stores, Victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company's website and its brick and mortar store in Cincinnati. Cutting out the middleman allows Noble to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create \"stability\" in terms of sales expectations, Abby Sutton said. \"Everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation.\" It also creates a quicker \"feedback loop\" through which the Suttons can listen and respond to customer feedback. That's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the \"made in USA\" movement even though they wanted to. Through Victor, whose products range from $25 for a tee to $85 for a hooded sweatshirt, the Suttons hope to rehab American-made style's reputation as exclusively high-end and inaccessible, she said. \"There are people who value the idea of U.S.-made but have never taken the step,\" she said. \"If we can make it for the same price as a Gap sweatshirt, hopefully people will see it as easy choice.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American-made clothing brands try to cut out middleman, selling directly to consumers .\nPros include smaller margins that can lower prices for consumers .\nSocial media make finding customers easier, but it's still an uphill battle ."}]}

But one-nil is ‘the Spain Scoreline’. It’s the margin via which, according to the scorer Andrés Iniesta, Spain regained self-esteem and belief by winning at Old Trafford in 2007. Beating England, to those who were charged by Luis Aragonés with installing a ‘new’ form of play, put La Roja on the map again, Iniesta told me. Italy and France both followed months later — old foes, bogey teams. One-nil, one-nil. Spain on the march. Alvaro Morata capped his Spain debut with the winner against Ukraine on Friday night . One-nil, the scoreline, against the USA which saw Spain booed out of the country before Euro 2008. One-nil, the scoreline which gave them a technical knockout against Germany in the Final a couple of weeks later — narrow margin, total control. Champions. Portugal, Paraguay, Germany, Holland — four games, four goals, four clean sheets. One-nil to La Roja, world champions 2010. They had it within their repertoire to hit threes, fours, fives. But the single-goal win was a trademark. Own the ball, own the midfield, get the advantage, never look like conceding. But, Friday night in Seville at the beginning of Semana Santa (Holy Week) was something different. One-nil over Ukraine. A record 97th international match without conceding for ‘Saint’ Iker Casillas. A debut goal, after only 38 competitive minutes, for Álvaro Morata. In touch with Group C leaders Slovakia, who are the next home opponents — in Oviedo in September. The bare bones look good. The full X-ray much less so. Morata has all the hallmarks of an old style centre-forward who finishes . On another night, one of those ‘accident nights’ which hit every team every so often, Spain would have lost this one. On another night, Ruslan Rotan would have had a hat-trick. On this night, there was the sight of the Marquis del Bosque, for whom the game left ‘a bad taste in the mouth’, throwing his hands up in the air at the naivety and imprecision of the second half and roaring at his team: ‘What are you playing at lads?’ Transition. It can be a glorious, strategic, rewarding process — or an unmanaged, inglorious, frustrating decline. Quite where Spain are in that process is debatable. For seven years between 2007 and 2014, they dictated. But, just as when all dictatorships are overthrown, the subjects have had a good time stamping on the statues. Brazil in the Confederations Cup Final, Holland at the World Cup — La Roja were to be bullied, pushed around, made to chase, pressed to within an inch of their lives. The striker has struck up a 'thing' with Andrea Pirlo at Juventus . But there’s no doubt that renovation is afoot. Isco, Real Madrid’s gem of a midfielder, should have been at the World Cup, should probably have been a starter. Koke, dynamic, aggressive, intelligent — the heartbeat of an Atlético Madrid side which won the Spanish title and came within seconds of winning the Champions League — is now a fixture. Debuts have been given to Diego Costa, Juan Bernat, Paco Alcácer and David de Gea, while everyone waits for Javi Martínez and Thiago Alcántara to get fit. And stay fit. Yet Spain, Europe’s reigning champions, are fighting for their dignity and automatic qualification from this group because they could not control a 1-1 situation in Slovakia last year. They are sore and should be contemplating this midweek’s friendly against Holland with queries in their minds because they could neither augment, nor control, Friday night’s 28th-minute lead against a Ukraine side which at first came to defend and play on the break. Then, sniffing glory, piled runners forward through the Spain midfield, robbing possession and launching assaults on Casillas’ goal. It all makes the scorer much more interesting. What Spain require, even above some restored arrogance and self-confidence, even above key players avoiding injury, is for a prolific striker to emerge. Morata has also been likened to Real Madrid and France striker Benzema . In Raúl’s day, his goals patched up the fact that Spain didn’t have a world-class XI. Good, but not great. When David Villa and Fernando Torres took charge they would, regularly, add the goal or goals which gave sense, confidence, and purpose to La Roja controlling play via Xavi, David Silva, Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Marcos Senna and Sergio Busquets. Cutting edge. Costa — if del Bosque accepts that more direct, more vertical football, quarter-backed by Cesc Fabregas, is central to the renovation — may become vital. Meantime there’s Morata — once of Real Madrid, lately of Juventus. His former Madrid mentor, Míchel, himself a mighty forward, recently said that Morata, whose debut goal on Friday was more valuable than it was beautiful, was ‘part van Basten, part Benzema’. Now that is praise. It’s meant to mean that he has the direct No 9 repertoire which accounts for his 32 goals for Spain at junior levels and his tournament top-scoring performance last time La Rojita won the European Under-21 Championship. Holland's Marco Van Basten is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time . Equally, it speaks of his awareness of space and how to profit from it. ‘Sometimes you have to really “love” football to understand strikers,’ he says. ‘To understand, or spot, their movements behind strikers, the process of “opening up a defence”. ‘Some people can’t see it. Some think that if you haven’t scored you’ve not had a good game. Right now, first-touch, fluid, strategic football is in fashion — the old style centre-forward who finishes but is static is a vanishing species. If you don’t have much more to your game, you won’t play.’ When he did get to play he chose the No 7 for his back. With Spain, just like at Manchester United, that’s a special number. It belonged to Raúl, record scorer until along came Villa — now Spain’s record scorer, and not formally retired. ‘I dream of scoring my first goal for La Roja,’ Morata said on Thursday. Then: ‘I was angry at myself for missing an earlier chance, so I didn’t really celebrate when I scored,’ he told me on Friday evening after the dream arrived. Good mindset. At Juve, he has struck up a ‘thing’ with Andrea Pirlo. ‘He never looks up when he hits you a first-time pass, but you learn. You anticipate.’ Just as he did against Ukraine to sprint onto Koke’s volley-pass. Some of Spain’s transition will be played out through the talents of this guy. Part van Basten, part Benzema.

The youngest reality star sister has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers, despite insisting that her full lips are natural. But unable to afford £200 injectable chemical fillers, part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail Scott, from Salisbury in Wiltshire, was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version. Gail Scott was desperate to emulate Kylie Jenner's famous pout but didn't want to spend any money so sucked on a hairspray lid and was left with painful bruising above and below her lips . Gail had heard about a tool available online, which promises an enhanced look without injections. Buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips, temporarily giving an artificial plumped look. Instead of spending £30 on the product, she used the lid of a mini hairspray bottle instead. After placing it over her lips, she sucked for five minutes until her lips started to tingle. Initially she was delighted when she removed the lid to see her lips looked fuller. But minutes later she was left with painful  bruising around her mouth that has left her unable to model since and now she wants to issue a warning against the craze currently sweeping social media. Unable to afford £200 for injectable chemical fillers, part-time swimwear model and retail worker Gail was intrigued when she heard about a DIY version . Gail had heard about a tool available online whereby buyers suck into a lip shaped vessel to increase blood supply to the lips temporarily giving an artificial plumped look, but she decided to try her own method . She said: ‘I look like I’ve been punched in the mouth. Apart from the pain, the dark bruising above my mouth looks like a moustache. 'I feel ridiculous and I haven’t wanted to leave the house since. I thought I was saving money but it’s cost me a fortune in make-up trying to cover it up. 'My lips looked great after - but only for about three minutes until the bruising started and then my lips went down anyway. 'I want other women to know the dangers, it’s not worth it. I was lucky not to burst a blood vessel because since I posted my warning I’ve heard that can happen.’ Kylie Jenner has sparked a huge craze for lip fillers, despite insisting that her full lips are natural . Gail says she feels ridiculous and hasn't wanted to leave the house since the incident, even having to forego modelling until her bruising heals . Gail had been saving for lip fillers ever since Kylie Jenner’s pout sparked a huge craze for lip enhancements. Gail explains: ‘I know a lot of girls who have had it done because they like the way her lips look. It’s never been so popular.’ So keen to keep up with her peers, Gail planned to have the procedure, too. She explains: ‘It wasn’t that I was unhappy with my lips, I’ve never had an issue with them, but I liked the way enhanced lips look, especially around the cupids bow.' But at £200 a time she was struggling to save the cash. She said: ‘I wanted it done earlier this year but I’ve been saving for a holiday and then my laptop broke so when heard about a cheaper way I decided to try it.’ Gail is warning other women who may have heard about DIY lip jobs to steer well clear after her botched attempt that left her in serious pain . However, her thrifty attempt has left her worse off than she was before and she's turned to make-up to try and cover the bruising and says she won’t be able to model again until it’s healed completely. 'I thought I’d saved money but it’s probably cost me that in foundation trying to cover it,’ she added. Gail posted a warning on her own Facebook page at the weekend and says she has since been thanked by other women who were planning to perform DIY lip jobs. She said: ‘I have been lucky. I’ve since heard of other women who have actually burst blood vessels doing this.

Tribunal chairman, Ian Callinan QC, ruled that the Sharks board failed to allow the 29-year-old footballer due process before severing his contract. This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June. Mr Carney's contract was torn up after a photo emerged of the player urinating in his own mouth . The committee’s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board. Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure. “The big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,’’ Keogh told The Telegraph. Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion' “What’s important to remember here is that it’s not a question of the facts, it’s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same. He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.' There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts . The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans. After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league. The disgraced player fled to France to pick up the pieces of his damaged career where he sustained a rib injury . As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player? Paul Gallen has spoken out on Triple M Radio saying he thinks Mr Carney should allowed to return to the league however he would need a strict contract to curb his bad behaviour. ‘If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life,’ says Paul Gallen . ‘If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life.’ Rumours are flying on Twitter that the Manly Sea Eagles might be in the market for a five-eighth after the Kieran Foran announced he would be moving to Parramatta in the 2016 season. Rumours are starting to circulate about the former Cronulla player's options for the 2016 season .

In another scene Jennie Bond, 64, is seen giggling and talking about how much she loves eating grapes after experimenting with hash. A trailer for tonight’s programme asks: ‘Has Jennie got the munchies?’ Scroll down for videos . Jennie Bond, who worked as the BBC's royal correspondent for 14 years, inhaled potent 'skunk' cannabis as part of a six-month scientific experiment for a new Channel 4 programme called Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial . The 64-year-old mother said she didn't like the experience of taking cannabis but 'certainly didn't hate it' Yesterday critics and experts accused Channel 4 of turning Drugs Live: Cannabis On Trial into little more than a stunt designed to boost ratings and glamorise the Class B drug. The programme sees 22 volunteers including Miss Bond, presenter Jon Snow and former Tory MP Matthew Parris take two sorts of cannabis – hash and high-strength skunk – plus a placebo. Each has tests including a brain scan, while changes to their mood, memories and emotions are monitored. Professor David Nutt, 63, who was sacked as the Government’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and nicotine, will appear as an expert, with University College London professor Val Curran. Professor Nutt’s charity DrugScience contributed funding towards the Channel 4 trial. She could be seen giggling with researchers at University College London where the six-month trial took place . Mary Brett, chairman of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Skunk is a dreadful drug and it is very irresponsible to have a show with such biased experts. It will be a platform for Professor Nutt to peddle what he thinks about drugs to an audience of young people.’ Julia Manning, chief executive of independent think-tank 2020 Health, said: ‘What I don’t think we should be doing is encouraging experimentation with substances when there is no doubt these substances have significant side-effects. This is not about science, it’s about viewing figures. The legislation we have seems to be deterring drug taking so why do we need to open the Pandora’s box and encourage more experimentation? ‘It’s glamorising and trivialising the issue.’ Snow, 67, who was given a brain scan after trying the drug, said: ‘I’ve worked in war zones, but I’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as I was when I was in the MRI scanner after taking skunk. I would never do it again.’ The scientific experiment, which has been approved by the Home Office, is being documented to try and demonstrate the effects potent 'skunk' cannabis has on the brain. Ms Bond said the drug made her feel 'floaty' In the footage, Ms Bond can be seen discussing her love of red grapes after inhaling the potent cannabis . But critics were concerned the programme would not show the long-term impact of cannabis use. Fay Watson, secretary general of Europe Against Drugs, said: ‘Placing someone into a MRI scanner when they are under the influence may be useful to assess the immediate impacts of cannabis, but it’s not going to demonstrate the long-term harms people are most concerned about. ‘Cannabis use is associated with a wide range of negative side-effects such as anxiety, psychotic episodes, depression, cancer, stroke, as well as IQ decline in young people.’ Cannabis, the most widely used illegal drug in Britain, has been linked to long-term mental health problems including schizophrenia, and is known to cause anxiety and paranoia. Users also find it difficult to concentrate. Skunk is a potent form of cannabis that now dominates 80 per cent of the British market. Some believe it is far more addictive than other forms of cannabis and can provoke paranoid episodes, psychotic symptoms and memory loss. Ms Bond (pictured with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) worked as the BBC's royal correspondent for 14 years . Broadcaster Jon Snow (pictured) also took part in the scientific experiment which was Government-approved . Channel 4 said Professor Nutt, a Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, and Professor Curran ‘are two of the world’s leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain’. A spokesman said the pair had ‘collaborated on this ethically approved six-month cannabis trial at UCL. ‘[They] will describe the chemicals in cannabis that are responsible for the effects seen in the brain. They will explain how they differ between the two forms of the drug, as well as looking at the risks and the potentially positive effects of cannabis.’ The spokesman added: 'It is absolutely not the case that the programme or scientific trial encourage people to take cannabis or glamorise it – they are giving people the facts. 'Anyone seeing the video of Jon Snow taking \"skunk\" in the trial will understand the potentially negative effects of the drug.' Mr Snow said that smoking the more potent cannabis 'outstripped anything' he had previously experienced . Jennie Bond (pictured) took part in the experiment for C4 programme Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial . I've been asked to do some pretty strange things in my time. Being buried in a coffin full of rats is just one of them. But I'm always up for a challenge, so when I was asked to take part in a drugs trial for Channel 4, I decided it would be both interesting and informative. The purpose of the trial was to show how skunk - the most common form of cannabis now sold on the streets - affects the brain and behaviour compared to weaker forms of cannabis. I was to be one of a number of volunteers to undergo the trial at University College London under the guidance of one of the world's leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain, Professor Val Curran. I smoked a bit of cannabis as a student at University. I enjoyed the mellowing effect, the relaxation and sometimes the uncontrollable giggling. So the idea of taking skunk didn't frighten me and I was intrigued to see how it differed from the weaker cannabis I used to smoke. I turned up for day one of the trial feeling nervous...mainly about how to inhale the stuff, as I gave up smoking more than thirty years ago. There was also the added twist of not knowing what I was taking. The trial was to be conducted over three separate days and I would be given skunk, low potency hash and a placebo. But I wasn't told - and still do not know - which I was given on each occasion. The first thing to say is that it wasn't in the least like the old days... lying back on velvet cushions in a darkened room, smoking weed and listening to Jimi Hendrix! The laboratory conditions, the camera in your face and the prospect of inhaling what seemed like gallons of the stuff through a vaporiser and a huge plastic bag was far from relaxing. It felt harsh in my throat and I had to inhale two whole bags of it. It smelled like cannabis and I felt a little dizzy. But, as I got used to the procedure, I felt no dramatic effects and decided this must be the placebo, which was rather disappointing. The next part of the experiment was to undergo a full MRI scan of the brain. Luckily I'm not claustrophobic (especially after being buried in a coffin in 'I'm A Celebrity') and find medical procedures fascinating. So,spending an hour in the scanner didn't bother me at all. In fact it was rather restful. During the scan I was asked to do a lengthy series of observation and memory tests. There was also a musical appreciation test, which struck me as rather odd but not too taxing. I felt fine, not at all stoned and I rather enjoyed the whole experience. The scientists were very encouraging, but I have no idea how well I did. I then had to inhale another huge bag of whatever it was and attempt another set of mental athletics. The tasks were straightforward enough: memorise a short report, select different coloured balls from jars you couldn't see, think of as many vegetables as possible. I was rubbish. I forgot almost the entire report, had no idea what I was doing with the balls and got fixated on vegetables beginning with the letter 'c' for some unknown reason. So was I stoned or just stupid? I still don't know - but I fear the latter! The second trial, a week, later, followed the same pattern. I felt I'd got better at inhaling and quite enjoyed the sweet smell. But, once again, I didn't feel particularly stoned. I suspected this was the cannabis of my University days. I do remember getting quite absurdly confused over the coloured balls test and finding it rather funny. And I was shocked that my blood pressure, normally quite low, had shot up to 150. Whatever I had taken clearly wasn't doing my body much good. When I arrived for my final trial, I was convinced I'd had the placebo and the cannabis...so this time it would be skunk. It seemed much harsher in my throat and I did feel quite stoned after the first two bags. It wasn't particularly pleasant; it made me rather dizzy but I also felt super relaxed. In the MRI scanner, the tests seemed no more difficult than before, but I had one hell of a job staying awake. After the third bag of whatever it was, I had an insatiable thirst and a love affair with a bunch of grapes! My memory was appalling again, but I don't think my concentration was badly affected. Once again, my blood pressure went through the roof. That scared me and made me realise just how dangerous drugs can be.

Sunderland banned Johnson, 27, pending the outcome of a police investigation after he was arrested on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. On Tuesday Johnson's bail was extended by five weeks until April 23. The club said in a statement: 'Following the decision by the police, the club will be reviewing its position.' Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, has had his bail extended until April 23 . The 27-year-old winger could feature for new manager Dick Advocaat in Sunderland's fight for survival . The gates at Johnson's £1.85million mansion were shut following his arrest earlier this month . Johnson  has been training with a fitness coach and if the club decide to lift his suspension the £10million winger could play his first match at home in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle on Easter Sunday. Johnson scored the only goal at St James' Park in the reverse fixture in December and it would prove a hostile environment in which to return. Before that, Sunderland travel to West Ham on Saturday with Advocaat in charge for the first time. Sportsmail understands that regardless of whether Advocaat keeps them in the Premier League, he will return to Holland in May. There is a feeling in his homeland that his wife, Dieuwke, has allowed the 67-year-old to fulfil his ambition of managing in England before he retires. Former Manchester City player Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . Johnson, pictured playing against Switzerland in 2011, has 12 England caps to his name . Sunderland owner Ellis Short said: 'Dick has an incredible c.v. and vast experience of managing at the very highest level. We have one aim only now — to climb the table.' Advocaat said: 'Sunderland is a big club and I am very much looking forward to the challenge. I can't wait to get started.' But Sunderland do not see the former Rangers and Holland chief as a long-term option. It is understood sporting director Lee Congerton will speak to Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement — with whom he worked at Chelsea — about a summer appointment. At 42 and with a reputation as one of Europe's finest coaches, Clement is the sort of head coach the club want to bring stability and long-term vision.

Gus Poyet was sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the Premier League relegation zone .

'When I first signed I had a lot of problems with injuries and I remember my hamstring going for about the fourth time. I was sat on the bench nearly in tears. He came across, put his arm around me and told me everything would be OK. It was a nice touch and he had that in him.

Kurdish peshmerga forces claim to have accidentally killed Doiron in a friendly fires incident, after mistaking him for an Islamic militant . A Canadian special forces soldier was killed in a friendly fire incident after he and others ignored an order to stay in their car and showed up to the front line unannounced, a spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish forces said Sunday. The death Friday of Sgt. Andrew Joseph Doiron marked Canada's first casualty as part of the U.S.-led coalition's war on the extremist Islamic State group. Canadian officials could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday on the peshmerga claim, though Canada's defense minister previously acknowledged Doiron's death came as a result of 'a case of mistaken identity.' Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hekmat said a group of Canadian soldiers showed up unannounced Friday to the village of Bashiq, in Iraq's Nineveh province near the militant-held city of Mosul. The area had seen heavy fighting against Islamic State militants the previous day. 'When they returned, the peshmerga asked them to identify themselves,' Hekmat told The Associated Press. 'They answered in Arabic, that's when peshmerga started shooting. It was their fault.' Hekmat added that he doesn't know why the Canadians were there. 'I consider it an improper action by the Canadians and illogical,' he said. Two Kurdish officials later told the AP that Doiron's body was flown to Canada early Sunday following a military ceremony at Irbil International Airport. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief journalists. Canada's defense department on Saturday announced the death of Doiron, a soldier in the Canadian Special Operations Regiment based at Garrison Petawawa, Ontario. Three other Canadian soldiers were wounded in the incident and are in stable condition, Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney said. Sgt Doiron and other soldiers were shot when they unexpectedly showed up at the front line in Bashiq, Iraq on Friday. Bashiq is located not far from the ISIS stronghold city of Mosul . Canada has 69 special forces soldiers with Kurdish peshmerga fighters in what the government calls an advising and assisting role. They were sent to help train Kurdish fighters last September in a mission that was billed as noncombat with the elite troops working far behind the front lines . The fact that Canadian special forces have been training and assisting on the front lines and directing airstrikes has stirred controversy in the country, but Kenney said the rules of engagement will remain the same. Kenney said Doiron's death had 'nothing to do with combat,' saying it was a case of mistaken identity on the part of Kurdish fighters at night. 'It was caused by a failure of identification. There will be an inquiry,' Kenney said. The Islamic State group currently holds a third of Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes targeting the extremists in August. So far, four other troops have been killed as part of the coalition, not counting Iraqi forces. They include a U.S. Marine presumed lost at sea in October, a Marine killed in a noncombat incident in Baghdad in October, a U.S. Air Force pilot killed in December when his jet crashed in Jordan and a captive Jordanian pilot burned to death in a cage by the Islamic State group."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sgt Andrew Joseph Doiron of the Canadian special forces killed Friday .\nKurdish peshmerga fighters mistakenly thought Sgt Doiron and comrades were Islamic militants .\nIncident happened in the Iraqi city of Bashiq, not far from the ISIS stronghold of Mosul ."}]}

The Ukip leader said the Conservative Party will emerge from the general election as the largest party but wouldn't have enough MPs to govern on their own. Mr Farage said he would force an early referendum on Britain's membership of the EU as his price for keeping David Cameron in Number 10. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Conservative Party will emerge from the general election as the largest party but wouldn't have enough MPs to govern on their own . The Ukip leader's intervention comes amid growing pressure on the Tories to rule out a power-sharing deal with Ukip after the election. Mr Cameron has repeatedly challenged Labour to reject a coalition with the SNP, but has side-stepped questions about whether the Conservatives would rely on Ukip to form a government. But Mr Farage said this morning said he would not have a choice. He said: 'At the end of the day, this is all about numbers, isn't it?' He added: 'I mean I still believe that the Conservatives will be the biggest party – not least of which is because Alex Salmond's party is doing so well in Scotland. 'I think between UKIP and possibly the DUP in Northern Ireland as well, there will be a body of MPs there to have significant influence and to force a referendum on our EU membership.' Mr Farage has previously insisted he would be willing to support a Tory minority government only if a referendum on Britain leaving the EU was held before the end of this year – two years earlier than David Cameron plans. Nigel Farage said Ukip would form an electoral pact with Northern Irish MPs to keep the Tories in power after the next election . The Tories have insisted that Mr Cameron needs two years to re-negotiate Britain's membership of the EU. But Mr Cameron said: 'Donald Tusk and Mr Juncker, the two bosses of the European Union, have made it perfectly clear there is no renegotiation. 'When it comes to the fundamental point of the free movement of people and immigration into the UK, which is the number one issue in British politics and I think between now and May 7 will start to dominate this General Election campaign, there is no renegotiation.' David Cameron may be forced to rely on Ukip and DUP MPs to stay as Prime Minister . Mr Tusk – the European Council president – last week claimed Mr Cameron's proposal for a new EU treaty was 'Mission Impossible'. But the Prime Minister, speaking in Brussels on Friday, said a Tory victory in the General Election would give him a 'very powerful mandate' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible. He added: 'Tom Cruise normally prevails in the end. He's a little bit smaller than me, but I hope to be just as effective.' But Mr Cameron has refused to rule out a coalition with Ukip, telling MailOnline: 'I don't want to have a coalition with anybody. 'I'm fighting for a majority government, there are 93 days to go and I'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory.' Last week the Chancellor George Osborne demanded that Labour say it would not form a coalition with the SNP, who are expected to make big gains in Scotland. But he refused to make the same promise about a Tory-Ukip tie-up. Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Osborne said: 'It's just total nonsense, voting for Nigel Farage makes Ed Miliband the likely Prime Minister and it means instead of getting the referendum on Europe we get no referendum at all, so that's what a vote for Ukip is about and it's a fundamentally different situation from the SNP, you were asking Ed Balls about it, he again refused to rule out a deal with the SNP. 'We are fighting for a majority, we only need 23 more seats to get that majority. 'Nigel Farage and indeed Ed Balls are trying to muddy the waters, it's a fundamentally different situation for this reason - Nigel Farage is not going to win seats in the House of Commons, even on his own boasts he's only going to win a small handful. 'The SNP are likely to win dozens of seats because of the collapse of the Labour party, Ed Miliband can't be Prime Minister without the support of Alex Salmond and that creates an alliance between those who want to bankrupt the country and those who want to break up the country.' Nigel Farage said Ukip MPs could join forces with DUP members, led by Nigel Dodds (left), in the Commons to keep David Cameron in Number 10 . Mr Farage has claimed that his party will win a 'handful' of seats at the election, which means the Tories would likely also need the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to maintain a minority government. Ukip would back the Tories' first budget if a referendum on Britain's EU membership was promised before the end of 2015. Up until now, the Prime Minister has vowed to hold a referendum by the end of 2017, and has said he will campaign to stay in a reformed EU. But the latest polls suggest neither the Conservatives or Labour will have enough seats to form a government, meaning Mr Cameron may have to find a compromise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ukip leader said the Tories will emerge from the election as largest party .\nBut he said David Cameron would not have enough MPs to form a majority .\nHe said Ukip would form a pact with the DUP to keep the Tories in power .\nIn return Ukip will demand an early in-out referendum on the EU ."}]}

If you’re fed up of apps asking to access your private data and don’t want advertisers tracking your every move, there is now a range of ‘spy’ phones designed to keep you off the grid. The original Blackphone was unveiled last year and its successor - the Blackphone 2 - as well as the first ever Blacktablet have been announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The range is fully encrypted by default and comes with a suite of secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to eavesdrop on or track. Blackphone’s Android-based devices are built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). They launched the original handset at last year’s Mobile World Congress and told MailOnline that the range is for people who ‘want to stay private without compromising on the features seen on typical Android phones.’ Everything from the custom-built PrivatOS to web browsing and apps, are encrypted, or have been fitted with an extra layer of security. PrivatOS is a so-called ‘skin’ that runs on top of traditional Android software, meaning all Android apps are compatible. The encryption on the Blackphone, Blackphone 2 and tablet is done via the Silent Circle and SpiderOak privacy and security software. Subscriptions are included for two years with each device, and they can then be renewed. As the firm explained: ‘There is no bloatware, no hooks to carriers, and no leaky data. ‘It puts privacy in the hands of you and your [business], without any sacrifices.’ For the Blackphone 2, this software has been upgraded to version 1.1, designed to separate work apps from personal ones through the use of multiple profiles on the same device. If the phone is locked, a business can remotely lock and wipe just the enterprise profile while letting the owner take control of the private profile. Internet access is carried out through a virtual private network (VPN) that sends and receives data in a way designed to keep it hidden. When the phone boots up, it asks for a password and PIN before a wizard guides users through the security options. Upgrade: Blackphone’s Android-based devices are built by Spanish manufacturer GeeksPhone alongside security experts Silent Circle and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) (handset specs shown) For example, this shows users which apps want access to which data. The Blackphone owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share. Mike Kershaw, chief architect from Blackphone told MailOnline the range was designed to have ‘the benefit of security without having to have an in-depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure.’ The company said it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up’ and added the phone will appeal to those who don't want any data collection, those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen.

The Blackphone 2 is larger than the original with a screen size of 5.5-inches compared to last year’s 4.7-inch. A 13MP camera has been added to the rear, up from 8MP, and a 5MP is now on the front. The Blackphone 2 has doubled the storage of its predecessor and added a longer battery life - although the firm didn’t give specifics. It will go on sale by June this year, although price details were not announced. Last year’s phone cost $629 (£376) plus shipping and the updated version is likely to cost roughly the same amount. Silent Circle subscriptions start at $12.95 (£8.40) a month for 100 Silent World Minutes in 120 destinations, up to $39.95 (£26) for 1,000 minutes. But this is included in the price of the phone or tablet. Private: The company said it is 'anti-personal data from the ground up’ and added the phone will appeal to those who don't want any data collection (original Blackphone model pictured) The firm didn’t reveal much more information about the new flagship tablet, other than it will go on sale later this year. A spokesperson said it decided to launch a tablet because many people don’t want to give up their everyday phone, but still want to have a certain level of privacy. ‘Public awareness of the erosion of privacy has never been higher,’ Phil Zimmermann, co-founder of Silent Circle told MailOnline at this year’s event in Barcelona. ‘There is a rising tide of news reports of the catastrophic loss of privacy, take Sony Pictures or the Gemalto hack of sim keys in recent weeks. There are almost daily incidents of company’s who’ve had their company data leaked. ‘Never before have people been aware of the excesses of pervasive surveillance from major governments.’ Silent Suite is the Blackphone’s core set of app that encrypts calls, texts and other communication to keep it private. It is available on PrivatOS but can also be installed on iOS and Android. Silent Circle subscriptions start at $12.95 (£8.40) a month for 100 Silent World Minutes to 120 destinations, up to $39.95 (£26) for 1,000 minutes. Features include: . Silent Phone: This lets users make private voice and video calls in HD clarity over a peer to-peer encrypted VoIP service. Silent Text: Share unlimited encrypted texts and transfer files. Includes Burn functionality to destroy selected messages automatically. Silent Contacts: Safeguards personal and business contacts by automatically encrypting the address book. Silent Store: Installed on all Blackphone devices, the privacy-focused app store features apps from the developers vetted by Silent Circle. Silent World: Silent World is an encrypted calling plan that lets users communicate privately with those who don't have Silent Phone. Silent Manager: Silent Manager gives businesses a way to privately manage plans, users and devices with ease. ‘A lot of android phones are tied into Google who want to learn a lot about what you do. ‘So there are a lot of things that you do that help them track your behaviours, but on the other hand they give you features for that. ‘Or take another example, Facebook. People love the features on Facebook – but people give up their privacy in order to benefit from the features. That’s built into Facebook’s business model. If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.’ Although the company touts the benefits of the device there is the possibility handsets such as Blackphone will be used by criminals to hide their activity. Addressing these concerns, Mr Zimmermann said: ‘Bonnie and Clyde, the famous bank robbers, almost a hundred years ago, revolutionised bank robbery by using cars to get away from the scene of the crime. ‘Police floated the idea that cars should be required to have smaller petrol tanks. Any new technology can be used by criminals to make their criminal activity work better for them.’ Blackphone’s managing director, Toby Weir-Jones told MailOnline: ‘The availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief. 'If you’re a bad guy, the fact [Blackphone] is making cryptography usable doesn’t mean you’re going to take that a step further; you're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Original Blackphone launched at last year’s Mobile World Congress .\nBlackphone 2 has a larger screen, better cameras and double storage .\nIt runs on the encrypted PrivatOS on Android plus Silent Suite apps .\nThese include private video and voice calls, texts and app store .\nFirm also announced tablet and both devices will go on sale later this year .\nNeither will be tied to a network nor will they ship with bloatware Price details have not yet been announced ."}]}

The former Motherwell manager has been put in charge until the end of the season. The decision to replace caretaker Kenny McDowall, who has now left the club, is the second major upheaval at the club in the space of a week following Dave King's boardroom coup last Friday. Stuart McCall has been named Rangers manager until the end of the season . McCall, like the club's new board, is a man the Light Blues faithful can trust following his trophy-laden stint as Rangers player during the mid-90s. But the 50-year-old does not believe the former regime, backed by Newcastle United owner Ashley's millions, would have welcomed him through the front door on Edmiston Drive so readily. He said: 'I don't think I'd have been offered the job if the new regime hadn't come in. 'I had a chat with John Gilligan yesterday and Paul Murray late last night. It was a whirlwind. 'I'm delighted for the people in charge of the club because I know how much it means to them. I'm delighted for the supporters because that is what they want. McCall will attempt to guide Rangers to promotion from the Championship to the Scottish Premiership . 'That's not to say the people on the board are going to be great successes.

An estimated 71% of the new insurance arises through Medicaid, using 2014 calculations based on analysis by Haislmaier and Gonshorowski of data from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. The harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients. Such \"insurance\" from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance  ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade. It is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable. Health care access for middle-class Americans is also significantly worsened by Obamacare's private insurance decrees. The law already forced termination of health insurance for millions of Americans estimated as 4.7 million by the Associated Press --  insurance they personally had chosen to buy. The Congressional Budget Office now projects that a stunning 10 million Americans will be forced off their chosen employer-based health insurance by 2021 -- a tenfold increase in the number that was initially projected back in 2011, at the onset of the law. Along with that forced change of coverage, many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors. Despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices, the Obamacare exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government's subsidies. McKinsey reported 68% of Obamacare insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks, double that of the previous year. For cancer care, the majority of America's best hospitals in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are not covered in most of their states' exchange plans. The \"narrow network\" strategy is about to hit even more Americans in 2015, as Obamacare exchanges from California to New Hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself, according to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times. And a study in late 2014 commissioned by the prestigious American Heart Association determined that the specialists essential to diagnose and treat stroke, one of the most disabling and lethal diseases in the United States, are in severe shortage under Obamacare insurance exchange plans. Indeed, unless one has the financial resources or power to skirt the new system, many of America's top doctors and hospitals are no longer available. Obamacare has forced Americans onto a far more government-dominated health care pathway than in the past. Coupled with population aging, the 107 million under the government's Medicaid or Medicare insurance in 2013 will rapidly increase to 135 million just five years later, a growth rate tripling that of private insurance. By the end of the decade, a full 140 million Americans will have their health care access directly controlled by government insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. More doctors than ever  already refuse Medicaid and Medicare due to inadequate payments for care, and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements. Less appreciated is that inadequate payments to doctors by government insurance substantially increase private insurance premiums. Back in 2008, a shortfall of over $88 billion of payment from Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries added more than $1,500 extra per year in premiums and $1,800 extra in total out-of-pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance. As the government increases its role as insurer, it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals, so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals. And with increasing enrollment into government insurance, private premiums will undoubtedly rise even more. It is therefore absolutely critical for the new Congress to reject Obamacare and instead help individual Americans and their families, particularly middle class and poor Americans -- the people most harmed by Obamacare. Any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals: 1) help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs; 2) liberate the poor from Medicaid so they have actual access to medical care, as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor; and 3) add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value-seeking by consumers. The plan should not replicate the false claims of Obamacare supporters that recent slowdowns in health spending from economic downturns were somehow caused by Obamacare. The Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (PatientCARE) Act put forth this month by leading Republicans in Congress tries to do just that. This bill, also known as Coburn-Burr-Hatch, represents a serious plan to expand access to health care and reduce the nation's health care expenses. The Coburn-Burr-Hatch proposal incentivizes people to buy insurance they value, and it generates affordable options, instead of forcing the purchase of expensive insurance that individuals don't want. Current harmful barriers to interstate cooperation and anti-competitive impediments are reduced. Health savings plans are liberalized to allow everyone, not just the affluent, control over their health care dollar. Medicaid reforms provide options for individuals to buy private coverage, and the government provides significant financial support for lower income Americans. And no one is forced to spend their hard-earned money on something they do not want. As the Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday about the legitimacy of subsidies under the ACA, Americans must recognize the bigger picture about U.S. health reform. Contrary to the mantra that the GOP has no plan other than to repeal Obamacare, the truth is that it is the supporters of Obamacare are the ones who are single-minded. They are focused on maintaining the ACA without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with US health care -- its cost. Responsible leadership must focus on empowering patients instead of the government, before private health insurance and with that access to the excellence of America's medical system are eliminated for all but the affluent. Empowering individuals -- regardless of socioeconomic status -- with choices and information in order to facilitate access to care from the best doctors and hospitals in the world should be the thrust of any change to American health care. That's an American solution, and it's up to our elected officials to make sure it finally happens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scott Atlas: Nearly three-quarters of those insured under Obamacare were added to Medicaid .\nAccess to the best doctors is very limited; patients often have little choice of doctors, he says ."}]}

But if we're honest we need to look in the mirror too. Many of us abandoned the field by not voting in last year's midterm elections. Those of us who did vote elected more fire breathers than bridge builders to Congress. What's more, when we're invited to tell our representatives what we want, we can be as demagogic as they are. Remember the Town Hall meetings in the summer of 2009, which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care?  Who can forget the Massachusetts woman holding a picture of President Obama defaced to look like Hitler, who demanded to know why former Rep. Barney Frank supported the \"Nazi policy\" of extending health care to all? His frank response: \"Ma'am, trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table. I have no interest in doing it.\" Rather than blame our leaders for the dysfunction, we need to change the game.  We can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day. Consider two efforts to move beyond the contentious debate about climate change. In Washington, the Senate made a splash by voting for the first time to acknowledge that global warming is really happening. Unfortunately, senators couldn't agree on whether humans are changing the climate and what to do about it. Stalemate. Outside of the Beltway, in Southeast Florida, it's been five years since the region adopted a comprehensive climate action plan with 110 steps aimed at mitigating its dangers and reducing the region's carbon emissions. As research by Dan Kahan of Yale Law School shows, these counties took action not because Floridians are less divided over political issues, or less partisan, or more scientifically literate than the rest of America. No one sang Kumbaya or hugged a polar bear. Instead, Florida officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments, businesses and community groups. Local leaders appealed across party lines by framing the issue as one of protecting residents from rising sea levels and storm surges, rather than as a divisive referendum on whether to believe in climate science. Rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign, officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support. \"We recognize each other's differences,\" explained Susanne Torriente, Fort Lauderdale's assistant city manager, \"but also recognize that if we work together we can make South Florida more resilient.\" Given what Florida accomplished, Gov. Rick Scott's ban on using the terms \"climate change\" in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart, not smarmy. Florida is not alone.  Our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in well-designed forums where citizens and officials engage in give-and-take discussion and arrive at solutions. These forums have developed \"participatory budgets\" in many cities, energy policy in Texas and Nebraska, community policing in Chicago and much more. Some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy. For example, gerrymandering of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents, sapping their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation. As a North Carolina state senator once said, \"We are in the business of rigging elections.\" In response in 2010 Californians used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission, which redrew political districts that better reflected the state's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more productively. This is one reason why the state's budgeting process, once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits, has become less rancorous and more fiscally responsible.  Let's hope the Supreme Court doesn't kill this reform. But not every ballot initiative is as enlightened. Many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests, and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public's ability to evaluate them all. Oregon's legislature responded by creating a Citizens Initiative Review Board, which researches proposed ballot measures, deliberates about their pros and cons, and makes recommendations on how fellow citizens should vote. Many Oregonians rely on the board's recommendations, which are published in the state's voter guide and mailed to every household. Unlike politics as usual (and those infamous Town Hall meetings), these forums put citizens at the center of decision-making.  Citizens are challenged to deliberate with each other and forge agreements, with officials and experts joining the effort by giving testimony and feedback. Moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence, rather than engaging in hand-to-hand political combat. Grandstanding and obstructionism don't play as well in these forums as they do on the Senate floor, partisan media outlets or the local tavern. It's still politics, but it's a politics that offers better odds of success by engaging both citizens and officials productively. The people who participate, many of whom regard typical public meetings like Ebola, say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials, sometimes for the first time in their lives.  Can you imagine that? While there are experts who know how to design good forums, it's no easy task. As the health care Town Hall Meetings showed, simply throwing open the doors is not sufficient. Most people don't have the time to attend a forum, so they need to know whether people like them deliberated and the rules of engagement were fair. It's important to ensure that citizens can participate on equal terms. If we want to move beyond political stalemate, we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials. When these forums work, they put citizens and leaders on the same side of the chessboard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Americans like to complain about the political gridlock in Congress where nothing much gets done .\nChristopher Karpowitz and Chad Raphael: Public forums can be used to successfully tackle big issues ."}]}

During the four years that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state she used (brace yourselves) a personal email account! Perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that Barack Obama didn't read her emails. Either way, Republican attempts to turn this into Hillary's Roswell fall short of the mark. On a scale of one to Watergate, I'd give this three. It is true that by using a commercial account, Clinton opened herself up to being hacked. It is also true that the rules of the National Archives and Records Administration stipulate that personal emails should only be used in \"emergency situations\" -- and as a historian I recognize the need for transparency and for keeping a record of everything written and sent for the appreciation of future generations. And we'll recall, by the way, that officials in George W. Bush's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the Democrats for it. But whenever Clinton pinged an email to an official government account, then the conversation would still have been archived, and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway. The suggestion that she thought she might have \"something to hide\" would only make sense if she had used her personal account on some occasions but not others. She would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future. Clinton may be many things, but the Republicans have yet to throw the witchcraft charge. Jeb Bush is angry about Clinton's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters. He is keen that we should know that he has a website that documents all the email exchanges that he had as governor of Florida. Why on God's Earth he's chosen to construct this archive, I can't imagine. It's the kind of grand gesture that politicians imagine the voters will be swayed by but actually leaves us thinking, \"Don't you have better things to do than this?\" Or else wondering if there's been some careful selecting of the emails to put the former governor in a good light. Oh, there are some critical communications in the Jeb Bush archives. But I'm suspicious that he appears never once to have been contacted by a Nigerian prince to say that he has $12 million that he's trying to transfer out of the country or by a Russian lady looking for a husband. Perhaps such conversations took place through Bush's personal account -- in which case, we need to know what he said in reply. Of course there is a serious context to all of this: the Benghazi hearings. There is still much that the public has yet to be told, and Clinton's emails may well be critical to discerning the truth. But there is a far less serious context to \"email-gate,\" too: the presidential election. Literally every small slip that Clinton has ever made is obviously going to be turned into a huge thing -- including such breaches of office etiquette as using the wrong email account. Sources also told me that she sometimes puts her feet up on the desk and may have used the office phone for personal calls.

The report, issued by the Institute of Medicine, examined the public health impact of increasing the  age across the US to 19, 21 or 25. And it concluded that if it were to be raised to 21 now, it would result in about 249,000 fewer premature deaths for people born between 2000 and 2019. Raising legal tobacco age could lower the number of premature deaths in America by almost 250,000 . It could mean 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2million fewer years of life lost for the same generation, the report suggests. While the report does not make any recommendations, officials say, it provides the scientific guidance states and localities need to evaluate policies aimed at reducing and eliminating tobacco use by young people. It also intensifies renewed government efforts to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco on the heels of the 50th anniversary of the landmark 1964 surgeon general's report that launched the anti-smoking movement. Most states have set the age at 18, which is the federal minimum. Four states - Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah - have set the age at 19 and several localities, including New York City, have raised the minimum age to 21. Most states have set the legal age for buying tobacco at 18 - the federal minimum. But in some areas you have to be older: . 19: Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey, Utah . 21: Suffolk County; New York City; Evanston, Illinois; Columbia, Missouri; a number of towns in Massachusetts; Englewood, New Jersey and Hawaii County, Hawaii . Increasing the federal age would take an act of Congress, which mandated the report in a 2009 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. Survey results released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June showed fewer than 16 percent of the teens smoked a cigarette in the previous month — the lowest level since the government started doing the survey in 1991, when the rate was more than 27 percent. Another CDC study had already put the teen smoking rate below 16 percent, but experts tend to treat this survey's result as the official number. According to Thursday's report, 90 percent of the people who have ever smoked daily first tried a cigarette before 19 years of age and nearly all others tried their first cigarette before the age of 26. If the minimum age were to be raised to 19 today, the report says, there would be about a three percent decrease in smoking prevalence in 2100. Raising the legal age for buying tobacco to 21 could mean 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2million fewer years of life lost for the same generation, the report suggests . That decrease would rise to 12 percent if it were to be raised to age 21 and 16 percent if it were raised to age 25. There's a 'growing interest' in raising the minimum age to buy tobacco and knowing what the public health implications would be before they act, said the report's committee chair, Richard J. Bonnie, a medicine and law professor and director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

Families will be better off this year than they were when the Coalition came to power, independent experts said yesterday. In a boost to George Osborne, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was ‘very likely’ that household incomes would be higher this year than in 2010. The Chancellor’s claim that families would be £900 better off in 2015 was one of the key Tory messages in Wednesday’s Budget. The IFS also raised serious questions about Ed Miliband’s much-repeated counter-claim that families are £1,600 worse off than they were in 2010. In its annual post-Budget briefing yesterday, it suggested the Labour leader’s figure was out of date and failed to take account of rising pensioner incomes, surging employment or changes to the tax and benefit system. The think-tank’s verdict potentially deals a fatal blow to Mr Miliband’s claims of a cost of living ‘crisis’. In a further blow, the IFS said inequality in Britain had fallen under the Coalition. It also said Labour’s plans were so lax that Mr Miliband might borrow up to £25billion a year more than the Tories – piling up Britain’s £1.5trillion national debt indefinitely. But it did warn that the impact of coalition cuts had fallen most heavily on the poor, as a result of reductions in benefits. Mr Osborne seized on the IFS verdict last night as evidence that the Government’s plans are starting to deliver higher living standards for families despite the years of austerity needed to deal with the huge budget deficit left by Labour. The Chancellor said: ‘This is a very significant moment for our economic debate: on the day after the Budget, the independent IFS have confirmed the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that living standards are set to be higher in 2015 than in 2010. ‘This is more evidence that our plan is delivering for Britain’s families, and it demolishes Ed Miliband’s central claim in this election. I’m the first to say that the job of repairing our economy isn’t done, because the British people are still paying a huge price for Labour’s great recession, but Britain is on the right track and we must not turn back.’ The debate over living standards provoked a furious row between Labour and the Conservatives during Wednesday’s Budget. The IFS said Labour’s claim was based on figures from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, covering the period 2010-2014. Economist Robert Joyce said it was true that these figures show average earnings fell during this period. But he said more recent data showed earnings are now ‘growing’. And he warned the Labour statistics give only a partial view of total household income. The figures do not include pensions, which have received a substantial boost. Because they are gross figures they also do not include the impact of tax changes. And they do not reflect that fact that employment is up by almost two million – meaning many people who previously had no income are now earning. Mr Joyce said: ‘It is reasonable to think that real average incomes will surpass pre-crisis levels in 2015.’ The Chancellor’s claim that families would be £900 better off in 2015 was one of the key Tory messages in Wednesday’s Budget . He did not directly endorse Mr Osborne’s £900 figure, but said it was based on a ‘quite reasonable measure of living standards’. He said the IFS’s own forecasts also suggest a significant rise in living standards this year. The IFS ruling was not all good news for Mr Osborne. It said there was ‘no cause for celebration’ as Britain has suffered ‘by far the slowest recovery in modern history’. IFS director Paul Johnson said that real incomes were ‘very likely’ to be higher this year than in 2010. But he added: ‘We are, for sure, worse off than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007, or indeed back in 2010.’ The IFS also assessed Mr Miliband’s claim that the Coalition has produced a ‘recovery for the few’. Mr Johnson said research showed that ‘across the huge majority of the population, inequality has fallen since 2010’. The total burden of austerity since the start of the recession has fallen most heavily on the top 10 per cent of earners. But, if Labour raids on the rich before 2010 are stripped out, it is the poorest 10 per cent who have lost the biggest proportion of their income, because of cuts to benefits. Those in the middle have been left ‘remarkably unaffected,’ Mr Johnson said. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the findings were a ‘damning verdict’ on the Government. Ed Miliband claimed that families are £1,600 a year worse off compared to 2010 . In the aftermath of Wednesday’s Budget, the Tories and Labour have clashed bitterly over what will be a key General Election battleground: Are households better off now than in 2010? Here, the Daily Mail sorts the claim from the reality... What Ed Miliband says: In his Budget reply, the Labour leader repeated his claim – made ad nauseam in recent years – that: ‘This Chancellor has failed the working families of Britain. People are £1,600 a year worse off.’ Reality: The figure – the foundation of Labour’s ‘cost-of-living crisis’ – is based solely on gross earnings, not net incomes. This means it takes no account of any benefits a family receive or, crucially, the Coalition’s decision to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £10,600. To reach the figure of £1,600, Labour compares a person’s gross income with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation, which is discredited and has been replaced in the national accounts by the Consumer Price Index, which produces a significantly lower annual rate. Also, Labour’s calculation runs only to April 2014. Since then, wages have begun to rise significantly while the CPI inflation rate has fallen to just 0.3 per cent. What George Osborne says: On Wednesday, the Chancellor declared: ‘The facts show households on average will be around £900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis any more.’ Reality: Ed Balls immediately rubbished the figure, which is based on a measure called Real Household Disposable Income per capita, on the grounds that it also includes income received by churches, trades unions and charities. The Office for National Statistics includes these organisations in the calculation – which compares all financial incomings with outgoings – because they ‘are financed by households and their sole purpose is to serve households’. Ed Balls rubbished Osborne's suggestion that families are £900 better off than they were in 2010 . However, a recent ONS research paper found that if they were removed from the figures, the measure would have delivered a marginally more positive result for ordinary households and Mr Osborne – not less so, as Mr Balls implied. The figures the Chancellor used are based on forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility up to the end of 2015. The OBR said disposable incomes will grow by 3.1 per cent this year, the fastest since 2001. Verdict: The hammer was brought down in favour of Mr Osborne by the hugely respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said average household incomes ‘are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010’. It added that they could also be higher than their previous peak in 2009. Labour will point to the qualifying remark by the IFS that this ‘still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history. Having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration’. But the verdict is still a bitter blow to the Two Eds – whose ‘cost of living’ fox has now been shot. Last year, Mr Balls said the issue that will be centre stage in the election was the same question posed by Ronald Reagan in his first presidential campaign in 1980: ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ In the US, the answer back then was No – and it cost Jimmy Carter the Oval Office. The Tories will hope a Yes – albeit a qualified one – will similarly be enough to keep Labour out of No10. Wannabe Chancellor: Ed Balls still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths . He wants to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. But Ed Balls still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths. During an interview on Good Morning Britain yesterday, Labour’s shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on TV. It came as he struggled to respond to George Osborne’s Budget and admitted he would not reverse any of the measures announced – including the new Help to Buy Isas. Mr Balls appeared on the ITV show in a bid to lead Labour’s post-Budget fightback. At the end of his interview a tired-looking Mr Balls expressed relief he had not been asked any tricky arithmetic questions. He told host Susanna Reid: ‘I was pleased you didn’t ask me any maths questions this morning.’ Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: ‘Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.’ A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: ‘You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on his mother-in-law to do his maths.’ Mr Balls said: ‘The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother-in-law.’ Later, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Balls admitted it was ‘good’ that Mr Osborne announced help for savers with the £1,000 tax-free savings allowance. He also said the Help to Buy Isa was an ‘interesting idea’ that would not be scrapped if Labour wins in May and that he would keep the rise in the personal tax allowance – to go up from £10,600 to £11,000 by 2017-18. Asked if there was anything from Wednesday’s Budget he would reverse, Mr Balls said: ‘I thought it was quite empty. I don’t think there was too much in it. There’s nothing I’m saying to you from yesterday that I need to reverse. What I will reverse is the plan for deeper spending cuts in the next three years than the last five.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "'Very likely' household incomes will be higher than in 2010, experts say .\nOsborne's claim that families will be £900 better off was key Budget pledge .\nFinancial experts also raised questions about Ed Miliband's counter-claims .\nLabour leader said families are are £1,600 worse off than they were in 2010 .\nBut a think-tank said Miliband's figure was out of date and not correct ."}]}

Hamilton's world championship defence got off to a flying start on Sunday with a crushing victory for Mercedes in the season-opening Melbourne race as F1 rivals succumbed to a farcical rash of reliability problems. Pole-sitter Hamilton started from a grid reduced to 15 cars from a possible 20 and cruised to his 34th race win with a 1.3sec gap to runner-up team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . Hamilton stormed to victory at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix following a dominant performance . Nico Rosberg followed Hamilton home as Mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination . By the time fans were heading out of Albert Park, Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko was discussing the possibility of billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz falling out of love with the sport and leaving. Appearing on an afternoon TV show in Sydney on Tuesday, Hamilton agreed that Mercedes' dominance had caused controversy and responded to suggestions of a possible Red Bull withdrawal by saying all the other teams could do better. 'It's very interesting to hear that when they dominated for four years, big time. They've not had a good couple of years - they didn't do so bad last year.

Helmut Marko (left, with former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel) says the team will evaluate the situation . 'But you've seen a real big improvement from Ferrari, they've actually overtaken Red Bull and Williams have made a really big step and I think you're going to have to watch them really closely this year. 'There's a lot of potential, particularly in the rules for them to make big steps and close the gap. So we still have a fight on our hands,' said Hamilton. There have been suggestions that F1 is too technical and complicated. but Hamilton did not agree. 'It's not for us...So you've got to hire some better people I guess. Ultimately it's a test and a challenge of evolution, of innovation and we've hired great people to - and we've done a great job and we weren't complaining when they were doing.' Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between 2010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Asked if criticism was just 'sour grapes', the British champion said: 'I'm not going to get into the political side of things, I just drive. I'm really grateful for, for what Mercedes have done as a team. 'There's over 1,000 people in our team who've done an amazing job, and the car's fantastic - best car I've ever driven, so happy with it and I want to really grab the opportunity with both hands and do the best job I can.' Asked if Mercedes' domination of Sunday's race was boring, Hamilton replied: 'Definitely wasn't for me!'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lewis Hamilton won the opening race of the season in Australia on Sunday .\nNico Rosberg finished second as Mercedes secured a one-two finish .\nRed Bull complained Mercedes dominance was making the sport boring .\nHamilton said that Red Bull should hire better people instead of complain .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest F1 news ."}]}

And, judging by Arsene Wenger’s decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, Theo Walcott seems to have become just that at Arsenal. Indeed there was, for portions of this match, a sense that Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck could form a clinical strike force in the Premier League for years to come – while Walcott warmed up on the touchline. Yet, even in the second half when things were not going right for Arsenal and they needed a spark to reignite them, Wenger instead turned to Tomas Rosicky ahead of Walcott to give some added impetus. And, as much as Walcott will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second-placed Manchester City, you can’t help but feel the England forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the Emirates. Theo Walcott has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over £100,000 a week . The England international was left on the bench for the game against Newcastle and didn't feature . Wojciech Szczesny and Walcott have both found their chances limited this for Arsenal this season . Because, put simply, where do you fit him into this Gunners side? Giroud is on fire and is leading the line superbly – he has scored 11 goals in 12 Premier League starts this season after his two at St James’ – Welbeck caused problems all afternoon, contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice, while Sanchez, although visibly tired, was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the Gunners on the front foot. Walcott is not an automatic selection anymore, and therefore he cannot be too ambitious with his wage demands. Arsenal’s form is superb – they have won 14 of 16 games since New Year’s Day – and they have achieved that largely without Walcott’s presence. The 26-year-old – yes, he is really still that young – has started just three top-flight games all season after returning from injury, and the Gunners haven’t exactly missed him. 2014/15 - All competitions . 11 appearances (5 starts), 3 goals . Overall - All competitions . 294 appearances (190 starts), 72 goals . Right now the Gunners are playing with pace and panache – displayed perfectly when Welbeck, Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey combined to take Arsenal from one side of the field to the other, only for Mike Williamson to make a timely interception. This was just one example of when Arsenal’s front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first-half display. Yet, despite that, their goals at St James’ Park came from a direct source. Giroud loves scoring against Newcastle anyway, and now has eight in seven against them, but the way he calmly kneed in his first after Welbeck’s flick-on highlights a player with confidence. His second was also a decent header, although he didn’t even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by Williamson. Unfortunately for Walcott, height and an aerial presence will make Giroud first-choice centre forward every time. Alexis Sanchez (left) has been a revelation since signing for the club from Barcelona in the summer . Oliver Giroud (12) scored an impressive double at St James' Park to continue his excellent form . Despite returning from a serious injury, Walcott has struggled to earn a place in Wenger's starting 11 . Welbeck offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three, while Sanchez on his day is simply world class. They may not have been at their absolute best against Newcastle, but they got the job done. But on saying all of that, if Wenger does not offer Walcott a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games’ worth of Premier League experience and 47 strikes in England’s top flight to one of his rivals. Is he really willing to risk that? Perhaps though, given Walcott’s shocking injury record, Wenger thinks he has replaced one ‘W’ for another – with the £16million acquisition of Welbeck increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the Frenchman. Will Walcott or Wenger blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the England winger seems to have had with the club? On the basis of Saturday’s match, you get the impression the England striker may be knocking on the manager’s door with his tail between his legs sometime soon. Danny Welbeck (right) terrorised the Newcastle defence with his pace and looks to be settling in well ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Theo Walcott wants his new contract to pay over £100,000 a week .\nOliver Giroud, Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez are beginning to form an exciting partnership and were impressive against Newcastle .\nArsene Wenger wants to keep Walcott but has bulked at his demands .\nClick here for all the latest Arsenal news ."}]}

Cassandra Naud, 22, says she loves her unique appearance and even credits her birthmark for making her memorable in her industry. The dancer, from Alberta, Canada, who was once told by a casting agent to digitally erase her birthmark from her headshots, says that she believes it is a positive attribute. Scroll down for video . Cassandra refused to have her birthmark removed as she was told she would be left with severe scarring . 'My birthmark is a huge part of me,' she says. 'It makes me unique and memorable, which is especially important for the career I've chosen.' When Cassandra was born with a huge brown birthmark on her right cheek, her parents, Richard, 60, a power engineer, and France, 50, a school caretaker, were given the option to have it removed, but concerned that it would leave her face heavily scarred, they decided against it. Cassandra says she is happy with the decision that her parents made as the effects of surgery could have been extremely damaging. 'As my birthmark sunk through several layers of skin, plastic surgery was the only option for removal. Doctors gave my parents a choice, warning them there could be scarring or I could be left with a lazy eye,' she says. 'I'm so glad my parents chose to leave my birthmark as it's part of who I am. Having a birthmark distinguishes me - and I don't feel that it has ever held me back.' Cassandra Naud was born with a large birthmark under her right eye but rather than have it removed she has chosen to embrace her individuality . Cassandra works as a professional dancer and believes that her birthmark makes her more memorable . Cassandra, pictured with her mother and father, says she is thrilled that neither she or her parents went through with the removal of her birthmark . With her envious dancer body and gorgeous smile, Cassandra is used to attracting attention from strangers, but she says people are often very curious when they notice her birthmark. 'People come up to me in the street and ask me about it. I don't shy away from questions - it's natural to be curious. 'It's covered in hair which makes it difficult to disguise, but I honestly don't mind. I know some people might feel sorry for me, but I'm confident in how I look.' Cassandra hasn't always been so confident as during her school years, she was the victim of cruel taunts from bullies. She says: 'They'd taunt me saying: \"You'll get beat up in high school\" and \"The hair on your cheek is gross\". 'Their cruel remarks were hard to deal with and I'd often fight back tears. I felt ugly - even if only for that moment - and I was terrified of how I'd be treated once I got to high school.' After years of bullying, Cassandra was plagued by feelings of wanting to fit in and, aged 13, she gave her mum some shocking news. When Cassandra was born her parents were given the option of having the birthmark removed but concerned about scarring they decided against surgery. Pictured: Father Richard, mother France and brother Oliver . While she was growing up Cassandra, pictured with her mum France, suffered cruel taunts from bullies and even considered having her birthmark removed in her early teens . She says: 'I told my mum that I wanted to remove my birthmark. My parents were shocked but understanding of my decision and immediately booked an appointment with a plastic surgeon. 'He explained the scarring I'd be left with and I immediately changed my mind. I figured it wouldn't be worth it and told my mum that I'd prefer to keep my individuality. 'It was a moment of madness, but I'm so glad I made the decision to keep it.' After high school, Cassandra studied dance theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles, California, where she starred in a production of musical, Cabaret. Cassandra graduated from the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in LA last year . She has previously been told by casting directors to have it removed from headshots but she has chosen to ignore them as she thinks it helps her stand out in the industry . She graduated in July 2014 and stayed in LA where she now works as a professional dancer, recently starring in a promotion for sport's channel ESPN, which featured Maroon 5. Cassandra has also branched out into kids' entertainment having also worked on popular kid's channel, Nickelodeon. She says: 'A lot of roles require the performers to have a certain appearance. I'm never going to be hired by Disney, for example, because they want the 'perfect' look but I'm OK with that. 'I don't often face prejudice, but one agent told me to Photoshop my birthmark out of my head shots. Wanting to please, I agreed at first, despite feeling shocked they'd asked. But then I changed my mind.' Cassandra's birthmark has not prevented her from finding love with boyfriend Patrick Cook . Cassandra's birthmark has not stopped her from finding love and is currently in a relationship with boyfriend Patrick Cook, 21, after meeting eight months ago in Los Angeles. Cassandra says: 'We met at an audition for a dancing role and we've been inseparable ever since. He always tells me I'm beautiful.' Despite the unpredictable nature of the entertainment industry, Cassandra's parents have been supportive of her career. And now the dancer wants to urge other people to love themselves - exactly as they are. She says: 'People should appreciate their individuality. 'Times are changing, so don't worry about looking normal.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. LondonApple CEO Tim Cook has released the much-anticipated Apple watch -- his company's first new product since the iPad. Cook said the new watch, in addition to telling the time, was a \"comprehensive health and fitness companion.\" But we're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time. Our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users. But they also have a hidden, darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about. As part of a research project with Alberto Rizzoli, we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches. One participant, a judge, hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention. The dilemma is familiar to many of us. We spend our days engaged in social interaction. Huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues. However when we are in these meetings, our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up. We may want to check these incoming messages, but know it would be rude to glance at our phone. When one of the first smartwatches came to market, the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem. We found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive. It also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone. Surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches. They were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count. We also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the \"phantom device effect.\" They would compulsive check their watch not just for the time, but for a wide range of information. In some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist. Some would feel a phantom buzz, notifying them of an imaginary incoming email. The phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become. Recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day, starting just minutes after waking up. We also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events. We used to worry that the average American watched television for six hours a day. Now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we're awake. Indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep. This raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives. In the work Carl Cederström and I have done on the hidden dangers of wearables, a big big concern is privacy. The Apple Watch, like most wearables, is essentially a tracking device, recording heart rate, sleep patterns, movement, whereabouts, and much more depending on the apps installed. All this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis. The result? A database of personal information of which the Stasi could only have dreamed. As well as sucking up personal information, wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness. By pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop, we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms. Data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace, making people not just health conscious, but also self-obsessed. Instead of checking in with social networks, we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms. As a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world. As we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past. Not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry. As a result, we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves, giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy. If Apple's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches, it's likely to create a step change in our lives. We already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago. Widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails, people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream, planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings. Rather than talking about what was on television last night, people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns. When this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived.

The Slovakia defender is alleged to have deliberately trodden on goalkeeper David de Gea towards the end of United’s 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday, leading to an angry confrontation between the two players after the final whistle. The FA were able to take action after referee Martin Atkinson confirmed that he did not see the incident, and a three-man panel unanimously agreed that it was a red card offence. Skrtel, 30, has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg, with the FA to decide whether there was any intent . Skrtel avoided any punishment at the time, with Martin Atkinson blowing for full time seconds later . Liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when Skrtel followed through on David De Gea but Atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win. Teammate Steven Gerrard has already been hit with a three-match ban after he was sent off for stamping on Ander Herrera just 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute. It would be a further blow to Liverpool’s hopes of overhauling United in the race for a top-four finish if Skrtel is suspended as well. The centre-back was pushed forward in search of an equaliser and trod on De Gea as the United goalkeeper slid in to gather the ball at his feet. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted that the video footage did not look good in slow motion, but insisted that Skrtel was going for the ball. He said: ‘The ball has been played through and it looks like, when it is slowed down, that he has caught him with intent. I didn’t see it like that. He is trying to get the ball.’ But a statement from the FA read: ‘Martin Skrtel has been charged by the FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video. ‘In Premier League matches, if an incident has not been seen by the match officials, a three-man panel of former elite officials will be asked by the FA to review the footage independently of each other. ‘For an FA charge to follow, all three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence. In this instance, the decision by the panel was unanimous.’ Brendan Rodgers has defended his player's actions, claiming that Skrtel is 'not that type of player' Rodgers believes his defender landed on the Manchester United keeper accidentally as he went for the ba . Liverpool will already be missing Steven Gerrard for the next three games, after his red card on Sunday . Martin Skrtel has been charged by The FA for violent conduct following an on-field incident which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video. The charge is in relation to an incident involving the Liverpool defender and Manchester United's David de Gea which occurred in the 95th minute of Sunday's game. The player has until 6pm on 24 March 2015 to respond to the charge. In Premier League matches, if an incident has not been seen by the match officials, a three-man panel of former elite officials will be asked by The FA to review the footage independently of each other.

The Barclays Premier League champions, who must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since the start of the 2011-12 season. Despite spending an extravagant amount of money, Martin Demichelis and Fernando are the only two players who have managed to hold down a regular starting spot since sealing moves to the Etihad Stadium. Man City have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since 2011 despite spending £327m - Aleksandar Kolarov will replace Gael Clichy from the side defeated by Barcelona on February 24, 2015 . Fernando has replaced Gareth Barry while Martin Demichelis has come in for Joleon Lescott - above picture was taken before Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Napoli on September 14, 2011 . The aforementioned duo have replaced Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry respectively in what is perceived to be Manchester City's strongest line-up. Gael Clichy has come close to edging his way into Manchester City's side but he shares left back duties with Aleksandar Kolarov and is suspended on Wednesday after being sent off in the first leg. Their major European rivals, on the other hand, have made at least six changes to their starting line-ups. Arsenal have made the most with 10 while upcoming opponents Barcelona have made six. Manchester City may have to change tack in Europe if they crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday, as a side of their calibre should be progressing to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious competition. 2011: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko . 2015: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Fernando, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko (two changes) Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) have joined Lionel Messi (right) at the Nou Camp . 2011: Valdes; Alves, Puyol, Pique, Abidal; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Villa, Messi, Pedro . 2015: Ter Stegen; Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Six changes) European champions Real Madrid have made six major changes in the same period - with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale sealing moves to the Santiago Bernabeu during the last four years.

A press event held in San Francisco revealed the collection that will range in price from $349 to $17,000 (£299 to £13,500 in the UK). It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. The devices are due to go on sale on April 24, but how do they compare to rivals' smartwatches? And can Apple crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date? Here MailOnline looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market. Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel, Sport is made of Aluminum and the premium Edition comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold . Moto 360 . The Moto 360 watch launched in September 2014 and won praise for its stylish, circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised-looking Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch. It features a 1.5in LCD touchscreen encircled by a thin metal band and is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system. The Moto 360 - which is available now in the US - is also $100 cheaper than the Apple Watch. Despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours, tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the Apple Watch and almost two days shorter than the Samsung Gear S. Like with Apple's Watch, batter life depends on usage. The device reviews at the time of its launch were mixed. 'Like all other watches in this class, you'll have to get used to charging every night, and occasionally you'll need to top off during the day,' wrote Android Central. 'The display resolution isn't as good as other choices. And the Android Wear software itself is still is in its infancy.' The Moto 360 launched last year and is available for $250 in the US and £199 in the UK . Samsung Gear S . Samsung - the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector. This included the Samsung Galaxy Gear that was released in September 2013. Despite their early foray into the market, their appeal and functionality was limited and the Galaxy Gear was too big for even the largest wrists. The Samsung Gear S was unveiled in August 2014 . Its new watch is called the Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit more comfortably on the wearer's wrist than its previous models. The watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance. The screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps. It offers 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so that users can receive notifications from social networks, calendars and apps, without needing to use their smartphone. People wearing the device can reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or 'S voice functionality' so they can dictate a message. Engineer and tech expert Sami Mughal from OxGadgets told MailOnline: 'Apple are Marmite at the moment; you either love them or hate them. 'Most Android fans fall in the latter category, and they'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the Samsung badge on it.' The watch is the cheapest on the market at $199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days, meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night. However, the watches run on Tizen OS, a fledgling mobile operating system, rather than Google's Android software. LG G watch R . LG joined Motorola as the latest manufacturer to release a smartwatch with a round face in September last year. It runs Android Wear, has a 1.3in diameter touchscreen and comes with 4GB of storage. As well as being waterproof, the watch features a heart-rate sensor on the rear, but doesn't have a GPS sensor. It connects to any Android phone running 4.3 or higher, via Bluetooth, and can also be controlled using voice commands. At $332 it is more expensive than the Moto 360 and the Samsung Gear S, but is still cheaper than the Apple Watch. 'Android Wear needs more work,' said John McCann at TechRadar. 'It feels odd talking to your wrist and the price tag is hard to swallow. The LG Watch R is available with a choice of two straps, the first is made from leather, while the second is a metallic-link strap . Huawei watch . The Huawei Watch is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor. The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches later this year. The watch will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information has not been announced. The 1.4-inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels, giving it a 286 pixel-per-inch (PPI) density. By comparison, the Moto 360 which also has a circular screen has a PPI of 205. PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour and the higher the number, the better. The firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device. Last week, MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston tested the gadget at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. 'The screen is bright and clear, but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this,' she said. 'There will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and I can see it being popular with both sexes. Previous watches such as the Moto 360 feel more masculine, for example. 'Huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success, but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch I’ve seen.' Huawei chief executive Richard Yu, pictured, unveiled the watch in Barcelona earlier this month ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Apple unveiled its Watch today in minute detail at event in San Francisco .\nDevices go on sale on April 24 and range in price from $349 to $17,000 .\nApple Watch is more expensive than its rivals including Moto 360 .\nHas a longer battery life than Moto 360, but shorter than Samsung Gear S ."}]}

Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. A stock image is shown . The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. On a game reserve co-owned by Sean Hensman, three elephants passed the smell tests. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. ‘They work it out very, very quickly,’ he said. Stephen Lee, head scientist at the US Army Research Office, which backed the study financially, said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. This image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives . Last summer, researchers confirmed that African elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom. Scientists from the University of Tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal. They have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans. Previous studies have shown that the animals have well-developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain. They seem to be able to distinguish between two Kenyan ethnic groups—the Maasai, who spear elephants to demonstrate strength, and the Kamba, who pose little threat to the animals. The ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in Angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war. While there was peace, the land remained sown with mine fields. Some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them, though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past. Researchers decided to investigate and in Bela-Bela, a town north of the South African capital of Pretoria, elephants named Shan, Mussina and Chishuru were administered smelling tests. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In an experiment conducted at a game reserve, elephants (stock image) sniffed at buckets some of which contained TNT. They were rewarded with a treat of marula - a fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. The creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom . All other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only. In a second set of tests, the elephants scored 100 percent, detecting TNT in 23 out of 23 buckets when ‘distractor odours’ such as tea, bleach, soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets, she said. However, in the real world, making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger, but would be impractical too. To overcome this problem, unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant, which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives, Mr Hensman said. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets, and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance. Here, a member of Thailand's First Humanitarian Mine Action Unit uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines . Another possibility would be to replicate an elephant’s sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials, building on research with dogs and rats, Mr Lee said. He revealed that researchers are thinking of designing a sensor based on an elephant trunk, which puffs out air to stir up an area, and then sucks in air to smell. Florida International University participated in the initial research, and it was done on a ‘shoestring’ budget with volunteers. The findings of the experiment did not surprise George Wittemyer, an assistant professor at Colorado State University, who was not involved in the study. Research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom, partially because they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent. ‘Their world is primarily olfactory,’ he Professor Wittemyer said. ‘The sensitivity is recognised as being unparalleled.’ The experiment comes as elephant populations across Africa are threatened. Poachers across the continent have annually killed tens of thousands of elephants for their tusks in recent years because of a surge in demand for ivory in Asia, primarily China. Mine-detecting rats: Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell. Some of the creatures are trained by the charity Apopo and are used to detect explosives in Tanzania and Mozambique, which has many unexploded mines after decades of civil war. Giant African pouched rats are being used in Africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell (pictured) Bomble bees: In 2013, a team of scientists trained bees to sniff out explosives. The idea at the time was to house them in a hand detector, which could be used to sense a chemical in airports, for example. The bees were trained by exposing them to the scent that was detected while dangling a sugary drink in front of them. The insects, which stick out their tongues to get the sweet treat, quickly learned to associate the smell of the explosive or chemical with food. A trial was run at Heathrow Airport. 'Sniffer bees' have also been reared to detect landmines in the Balkans. The bees, which French and Croatian biologists say have an olfactory sense as good as dogs, will search out mines left by soldiers in the 1990s. Nearly 120,000 of the unexploded devices remain in more than 9,400 carefully marked minefields."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Research was conducted in South Africa and involved the US military .\nExperiment found elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell .\nAnimals were able to find TNT among buckets filled with distracting smells .\nSkill could be used to find buried landmines in former areas of conflict .\nDrones could collect mine field scent samples for elephant analysis .\nElephant's sense of smell could be used to inspire new sensors ."}]}

By five o’clock, he must have been wondering quite what he’d thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe Coventry City’s acute relegation anxieties. Mowbray had not stood on a touchline since October 19, 2013, when his Middlesbrough team were beaten 3-2 by Barnsley at Oakwell. The game has certainly not grown any kinder or more predictable in the meantime. Coventry's Jim O'Brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match . Coventry City: Burge, Phillips, Pennington, Martin, Stokes, O'Brien (Jackson 77),, Barton (Odelusi 62), Fleck, Nouble, Tudgay (Williams 63), Samuel . Subs not used: Webster, Turgott, Finch, Charles-Cook . Booked: O'Brien . Scorer(s): O'Brien 4, Odelusi 70 .

Booked: Dickinson, Inniss . Scorer(s): Pope 40, Marshall 45, O'Connor 76 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 9,446 . The 51-year-old Yorkshireman, late of Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Teesside, spoke of restoring City’s glory days when he arrived in the week. But his short-term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the Sky Blues, famously FA Cup winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years, from the indignity of League Two football. They remain above the relegation zone - just, by a sole point - after this 3-2 defeat but the new boss will be under no illusions that this is no time for grand future plans, just steely focus and cast-iron resolve. The initial signs had been so positive. On the first sunny afternoon of Spring, the whole place seemed energised by Mowbray’s arrival and Coventry had a precious lead just four minutes in. From the left, the ball was worked into Dominic Samuel’s feet but he couldn’t get them synchronised to shoot. Instead, he passed backwards to O’Brien in plenty of space and he picked out the bottom corner with a perfectly-placed shot from 20 yards. Tony Mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of Coventry . ‘We are staying up’, sang the home faithful, confident again that a club in the Premier League as recently as 2000-01 wouldn’t be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959. Mowbray - who spent most of the match stood, hands in pockets, on the edge of his technical area - betrayed little emotion. It was only a start, after all. The Sky Blues were well on top, looking threatening going forward and Samuel’s deflected shot from a good position had Chris Neal scrambling across. But Vale, who still harbour hopes of reaching the play-offs, slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half-time. First, Tom Pope was left with a straightforward side-foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area, nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility. There was a strong suspicion of offside, but the striker’s 11th goal of the season stood. Few will come as easily as that for him. Then, four minutes later, Coventry’s fragile confidence at the back was dented again. The impressive Mark Marshall played a neat one-two with Michael O’Connor around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish. The Coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start . To make matters worse, Marshall had been released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract. Marshall politely declined to celebrate. The travelling masses were less diplomatic, chanting ‘that’s why you’re going down.’ Mowbray sent his players out five minutes early for the second-half and, having composed themselves following the double blow before the break, they started on the front foot. O’Brien’s flighted cleared by Neal’s legs just a fraction ahead of the onrushing John Fleck and Aaron Phillips curled an effort wide from range. But they couldn’t sustain the bright start, allowing Vale to dictate things again. Byron Moore volleyed over the bar after a clever piece of chest control and Marshall tested Lee Burge with a low drive. The former Middlesbrough and Celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the Ricoh Arena . Then, out of nothing, an equaliser. Frank Nouble, brought back into the side by Mowbray, bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out Sanmi Odelusi bursting up on his right. After a touch to control, the substitute rifled home and in one swing of the boot, totally transformed the mood. A cloud of thick blue smoke rose in one corner from a flare as the home fans found their voices again. Not for long. From their next piece of attacking play, Vale were awarded a free-kick 25 yards out after O’Brien felled Michael Brown. Up stepped Michael O’Connor, bending the ball precisely around the wall and beyond the outstretched arm of Burge. Mowbray didn’t know where to look.

Allan Simonsen, who became the first Dane to represent the Catalan club when he joined in 1979, said the academy would offer young Danish prospects a new kind of footballing education. 'FC Barcelona comes with a new offer to the young people, who will come to learn an entirely different philosophy,' Simonsen told a news conference as plans for the FCBEscola academy, which will be based some 16km north-west of Copenhagen in Ballerup, were unveiled. Young Danish players could follow Lionel Messi (left) into the Barcelona first-team through a new academy . Allan Simonsen believes the new academy will give Danish players the chance to enjoy a new philosophy . 'I sincerely doubt that the philosophy is practised in very many places, so it will be completely new.' But reaction to the news was not all positive and the Danish FA (DBU) poured cold water on the idea. 'The DBU has still not received an official request from FC Barcelona about their desire for the establishment of an academy in Denmark, including specific information on what such a setup would contain,' the DBU said in a statement. 'It is a precondition for the establishment of such an academy in Denmark that it obtains the approval of the DBU.' The DBU's head of grassroots soccer Steen Joergensen expressed concern over the well-being of children and that Danish junior football could become a hotbed of competition between elite academies as youngsters chase the dream of turning professional. Former Denmark international Michael Laudrup played for Barcelona between 1989 and 1994 . 'For us it is important that FC Barcelona, like all others, manage to take care of both the child and the talent, so that there won't be tough competition with focus on the potential economic gain at too early an age,' he said in a statement. 'It is initially about childrens' well-being, happiness and security, which in our opinion are fundamental prerequisites for the development of children.' FCBEscola director Xevi Merce played down suggestions that the world-famous club's network of academies were a way of unearthing players who would then be spirited off to the La Masia academy in Spain, where Lionel Messi learned his trade. 'We are going to give a plus to Denmark, not to steal talents. We will develop and demonstrate our method, and then we will learn from Danish football,' he said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCBEscola academy will be based 16km north-west of Copenhagen .\nFormer Barcelona player Allan Simonsen says it will offer young players 'an entirely different philosophy'\nMichael Laudrup and Simonsen both represented the Catalan giants .\nThe Danish FA say they have not had an official request from Barcelona .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Barcelona news ."}]}

The augmented reality app was launched in Australia on Tuesday with a glittering event attended by the brand's local ambassador, Megan Gale. While make up apps have been around for a while, they have only ever worked on a static portrait. Scroll down for video . 'Genius': L'Oréal Paris' new make up app launched in Australia this week, allowing customers to try on over 4,500 of their products in real time using augmented reality technology . The Makeup Genius applies bronzer, eyeshadow, lip gloss, and eyeliner in real time using facial recognition technology, enabling the virtual make up to stay in place as you move your face. The technology captures 64 facial data points and 100 different facial expressions to accurately place the make up. The app scans your face, and then allows you to try out different products or entire make up looks. You can then save your selfie, share it on social media, and purchase the products directly through the app. Facial recognition: The virtual make up stays in place as you move your head and change your expression in real time and works in different lighting conditions - pictured are individual lip gloss and bronzer products . Makeover: While Femail editor Andrea liked testing the individual products, she found the pre-set 'looks' (above) a bit over the top... and one setting added unsightly red blotches to her chest (left) According to L'Oréal, the app works on all ethnicities and in over 400 different lighting conditions to ensure how the make up appears in the app is accurate to the product. Daily Mail Australia road-tested the app on a handful of staff, with mixed results. I tested out two looks - 'Caresse' and 'So Timeless', as well as the more natural-looking individual products like bronzer and eyeliner. The app was impressively accurate at placing the make up on my face, though it took a bit of adjusting to get some of the eyeliner looks perfect. While some of the 'looks' bordered on scary drag, testing out individual products was proved more successful. The bronzer and lip gloss looks appeared perfectly and gave me a solid idea of how they would look on my skin. Subtle: News reporter Sarah tried subtle eye shadow and lip gloss looks, and thinks the app managed to apply make up better than she could do herself . News reporter Sarah Dean tested 'Smokey Minute' look, as well as the 'Tropical' look. She also tested some subtle bronzer and winged eyeliner. 'I thought it was a really smart way of trying out new looks without having to stand in a make-up aisle and test things in front of tiny smudged mirrors,' she said. 'It’s also much more hygienic than using testers in the shops. 'The make-up looked like it had been applied professionally – probably better than I could actually do myself!' Editorial assistant Helen liked the naturally sunkissed look the Glam Bronze Duo gave her. Impressed: Editorial assistant Helen liked the subtlety of the lip gloss (left), and bronzer (right) and says it gave her a good idea of the looks she could achieve with the products . 'I thought it was a really great way of trying out the range of products available,' she said. 'Although you don’t get the chance to feel how the products work on your skin and how they apply as you would in a shop, you certainly get a good idea of the looks you can achieve with them.' Showbiz reporter Karishma Sarkari was less impressed, struggling to get the eyeliner and eyeshadow looks to place accurately. ‘While it was definitely a bit of fun trying out the different looks, the app seemed to put the make-up over my left eye a lot for some reason, despite trying to “calibrate” a number of times,' Karishma said. The major drawback of the app is that it sucked the life out of my phone - my battery, which had been at 100 per cent, was almost gone after 20 minutes playing with my make up. Dramatic eyes: Showbiz reporter Karishma enjoyed the effect of the bold winged eye liner, but found it took several attempts to get the placement of the make up right . The app has been downloaded 10 million times in the US, France and China, and L'Oréal is predicting 500,000 downloads in Australia this year. L'Oréal Paris Makeup Genius is a true game-changer in today's beauty industry and we are thrilled to be pioneering a new future of beauty,' said Cameron Woods, L'Oréal Paris Marketing Director. 'We are so proud to bring a true innovation to the market, providing what we hope is a genuinely useful, inspiring and educational tool for our consumers. 'In the virtual reality experience we allow a new and powerful way for our consumers to experience the world of beauty - testing and trying on products, viewing beauty tutorials, accessing personalised advice and purchasing their favourite products at the convenient click of a button.' L'Oréal Paris Makeup Genius is free and available to download for iOS and Android.

Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to 'sculpt' facial features . Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture . Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist . Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring . 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn’t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo – it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim’s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia . Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones . 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal . 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go . 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend . 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation . Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used . 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are ‘framing’ the face. Blend the contouring ‘in’ (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the ‘frame’ by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips . 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid . 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines . Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones . So, what is contouring exactly? 'It’s not just drawing lines on your face. It’s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don’t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer – it’s an illusion. You’re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don’t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I’d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it’s just about contour. They don’t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring . 'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.' Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday. 'A woman shouldn’t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don’t need to highlight and contour every day. 'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it’s easier, on the go, and you don’t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base – tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don’t look pale, blush, and you’re good to go. In demand: Professional make up artist Lilit Caradanian has over 840,000 Instagram followers and celebrity clients . There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.' And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You’re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.'

Ahead of this weekend's season-opening grand prix in Australia there is a feeling Mercedes will start the campaign as they finished 2014 - as the superior team. Last term Mercedes set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16, with current champion Hamilton claiming 11 of those, as well as equalling Red Bull's 2011 haul of 18 poles in a season. Lewis Hamilton poses on St Kilda beach on Thursday ahead of the season opener in Melbourne . The reigning world champion stands with a fan as she takes a selfie ahead of this week's Australian GP . Hamilton was speaking at the first pre-race press conference of the season in Melbourne on Thursday . While there was some relief Mercedes stopped Red Bull's four-year run of title-winning success, should they again blitz the field in 2015 then the already-declining global television audience figures may dip further. Assessing the situation, Hamilton said: 'A year of dominance is a great thing for a team as a whole, but as a racing driver I'm sure the fans will want to see close competition.' Asked if it would be bad for the sport should he win the title by August and whether the fans would get bored, Hamilton replied: 'Personally, I would get bored, but I can only speak for myself. Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg pose in front of the world's media ahead of the first race . Last term Mercedes set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16, with Hamilton claiming 11 . Hamilton speaks to the media next to St Kilda beach in Melbourne on Wednesday . 'If I was a fan watching and the championship was won by then it wouldn't look so good, would it? 'But then it's almost impossible to win it by then, and if you look at most of the recent seasons they've gone down to the last race.' Mercedes, however, were eye-catching over the three pre-season tests as they not only racked up the most laps, but also the quickest, and not even on the best type of rubber available. 'It's a work in progress, but of course it feels great,' said 30-year-old Hamilton, who starts the season favourite to win a third title. 'You know it's great to see all the work that's been put in by the team, and throughout testing it felt really good. Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Hamilton will go head-to-head again for the title . 'Testing is not always the greatest when you're in cooler conditions like in Jerez and Barcelona, but generally it was pretty awesome.' With the second title to his name and a car beneath him that is again going to be the one to beat, you would expect Hamilton to be relaxed heading into the new season, but far from it. Hamilton appreciates, as at the start of the any campaign, the hard work is only just beginning all over again. 'I definitely don't feel I have less pressure,' said Hamilton. Rosberg won the opening race in Australia last season after Hamilton suffered an engine problem . 'The pressure is the same it is every year, but honestly, I didn't arrive at the tests or here thinking, 'Okay, I'm world champion'. 'I'm thinking, 'Jesus, I've got to do everything again, and I've got to actually do it better than I did before'. 'I know everyone else will have taken a step as well, so how do I do that?

'I did indicate to him that we continue to believe that a two-state solution is the only way for the long-term security of Israel, if it wants to stay both a Jewish state and democratic,' Obama told The Huffington Post on Saturday.

The Mars rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container. The severity of the problem is not yet known, but Nasa said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved. A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving. Nasa engineers in California are now investigating the problem. The rover (shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container . 'We are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive,' said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'This gives us the best opportunity to determine where the short is.' The short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 February. When the rover detected the anomaly, it stopped the movement of its arm. Nasa said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations, or it 'could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism'. Quite how much lasting damage the short will have caused, if any, is not yet known. On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. Curiosity has successfully analysed five samples from drilling targets before in 2013 and 2014, but this is the first time this problem has arisen. On this particular occasion, Curiosity revealed the true colour of Mars was not red - but blue and grey. By drilling a few centimetres into the ground, the drill dug up material that had a different colouration to the surface. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. The material appears blueish-grey, seen here, because it had not yet oxidised in the Martian air . The reason is that Mars is mostly made of silicon and oxygen, and also contains significant quantities of iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium and potassium. When the soil is exposed to the air it oxidises and 'rusts', giving it its red appearance. 'We're sort of seeing a new colouration for Mars here, and it's an exciting one to us,' Joel Hurowitz, sampling system scientist for Curiosity at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said in a statement. This raw-color view from Curiosity's Mastcam shows the rover's drill just after finishing a drilling operation at Telegraph Peak on 24 February 2015. Three days later, a fault-protection action by the rover halted a process of transferring sample powder that was collected during this drilling . On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five [pictured]. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' One of the reasons for the particularly different colour might be the large amounts of silicon that were dug up, as analysed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the rover. 'When you graph the ratios of silica to magnesium and silica to aluminium, 'Telegraph Peak' is toward the end of the range we've seen,' said Curiosity co-investigator Doug Ming, from the Nasa Johnson Space Centre in the US. 'It's what you would expect if there has been some acidic leaching. We want to see what minerals are present where we found this chemistry.' Curiosity is now continuing to climb Mount Sharp, at the centre of Gale Crater, to look back into the geological history of Mars - and analyse soils at different altitudes. The rover had been transferring material to the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, seen here in a previous image taken by Curiosity. It has successfully analysed four drill samples before, but has not yet experienced this short circuit failure ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving .\nIt had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container .\nHowever an electrical problem then caused the rover to stop operations .\nNasa engineers in California are now investigating the problem .\nIf it can be solved the rover should begin operations again in a few days ."}]}

Not since late October, 21 fixtures ago, have the Hornets shared the points. It’s very much boom or bust under Slavisa Jokanovic and the pendulum is swinging in their direction at the moment. Against Fulham Troy Deeney’s 15th of the season secured their eighth win in the last ten. The signs are ominous for the rest and one of the first words out of the manager’s mouth afterwards was ‘champion’. Why not? They are just one point behind Middlesbrough. Troy Deeney (centre) fires home to give Watford the lead and send them third in the  Championship . The Hornets captain celebrates as his side continued their quest for an automatic promotion place . Watford starting XI (3-5-2): Gomes 6.5; Cathcart 7, Angella 7.5, Hoban 6; Motta 6, Abdi 8 (Forestieri - 86), Watson 7, Guedioura 7, Pudil 6.5 (Layun - 58 6); Deeney 7.5, Vydra 7 (Ighalo - 68 6) Subs not used: Bond, Paredes, Anya, Tozser, . Goals: Deeney 9 . Booked: Guedioura . Fulham starting XI (4-3-3): Bettinelli 6; Richards 6, Hutchinson 6, Bodurov 6, Stafylidis 6.5; Tunnicliffe 6, Fofana 7, Kavanagh 6.5 (Kačaniklić,- 76 6); Ruiz (Smith - 76 7), Woodrow 6.5 (Rodallega - 66 6), McCormack 7 . Subs not used: Kiraly, Hoogland, Amorebieta,  Dembélé . Booked: Richards, Fofana . ‘It’s nice winning 5-0 or 3-2 but sometimes it is difficult,’ Jokanovic said. ‘If you have a champion’s mentality you must suffer together and get through games like this. ‘They caused us problems. It’s positive for us because we were working all together. It wasn’t a brilliant game but you’ve got to be optimistic if you win these.’ It’s only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when Billy McKinlay left after a matter of days but Watford will take some stopping from here. When all is said and done in two months’ time, they will make sure not to hold any regrets. The winner came on nine minutes after Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, rather bizarrely, opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for Almen Abdi to whip in a wicked corner; from that Craig Cathcart’s header was partially saved but Deeney was on the spot to smash in the rebound. ‘Disappointing’ was Kit Symons’ summation. ‘It’s the second phase of a corner.’ Jokanovic’s side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at Vicarage Road before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and Ross McCormack might’ve drawn the visitors level soon after, only for his half-volley to be thwarted by former Tottenham stopper Heurelho Gomes. Ryan Tunnicliffe (centre) tussles with Almen Abdi for the ball during his side's defeat to Watford . Match winner Deeney fights with Kostas Stafylidis for possession during the first half at Vicarage Road . Despite Fulham looking bright, it was the Hornets who could’ve sewn the points up before half-time. Abdi is afforded the freedom to roam from his central berth and that gives Watford an added dimension. Capped by Switzerland, he buzzes in possession and isn’t afraid of bypassing Deeney and Matej Vydra in pursuit of goals. Here the two strikers combined brilliantly to tee Abdi up and he thumped just wide. Make no mistake, this was not vintage Watford but you sense they don’t need to be weekly, such is the quality stacked up in a well-stocked squad. Vydra crashed an effort against the bar after sparkling Adlene Guedioura footwork before Jazz Richards only saw yellow for raising his hands to the striker off the ball. Ben Watson (centre) climbs higher than Bryan Ruiz during his side's crucial victory over Fulham . Symons saw Cauley Woodrow head over from a corner and Seko Fofana’s vicious strike was deflected wide. Fulham failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker Matt Smith; his knockdown fell to McCormack but Gomes rushed out, spread himself and superbly blocked the Scot’s certain equaliser. ‘Matt did well when he came on,’ Symons said. ‘He’s a physical presence up there and we can play a bit more direct. There was a chance at the end when Hugo Rodallega and Ross got in each other’s way. We deserved a point.’ Watford might usually be a pleasure to watch, but they’ll be thankful for that mad Brazilian between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Watford move into third in the Sky Bet Championship following the win .\nTroy Deeney opened the scoring for high-flying Watford after nine minutes .\nHeurelho Gomes made crucial saves to prevent a Fulham equaliser ."}]}

But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video . People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares . Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun . These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings . Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun . Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch . The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. In this Nasa image, multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface . This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains: . 'When a solar eclipse occurs, what you’re witnessing is Earth, moon and the sun aligning. 'Eclipses can only really happen at a new moon. With this in mind, it’s quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon’s orbit around  Earth is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet’s, our natural satellite’s shadow usually misses the Earth’s surface by passing above or below it. 'It’s only really at least twice a year that the geometry lines up just right to make an eclipse for observers in a particular part of the world. 'The sun is roughly 400 times bigger than the moon but it is also around 400 times further away from us. As a result, the sun and the moon have the same size in the sky to make a partial or total eclipse. 'There are two types of eclipse - a partial and a total. During a partial solar eclipse, only some of the sun’s surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion. 'With a total eclipse, all of the Sun’s surface gets covered by the moon, creating a shadow that is projected onto  Earth. Day turns into darkness for a few minutes for observers in this shadow. 'However, when the moon passes in front of the sun, we don’t always get a total eclipse. 'Instead, we get an annular eclipse, also known as a ‘ring of fire’ - that’s when the Moon is at a further distance from the Earth in its orbit and therefore appears smaller, unable to cover the Sun’s disc entirely. 'At a distance of around 220,000 miles (357,000 kilometres) on 20 March though, the sun’s disc was sufficiently covered.' Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. In the Hebrides the sun was practically invisible as the Isle of Lewis experienced a 98 per cent eclipse, while the Faroe Islands saw a total eclipse. But cloud coverage meant that millions across Britain were unable to see anything at all of the eclipse, the like of which will not be seen again for several more decades. The last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on August 11 1999, and was 'total' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from Cornwall. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Away from this path the sun was partly obscured. A partial eclipse was visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. More than 100 people flocked to the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones on the Isle of Lewis to witness the solar eclipse. And they were rewarded most of the time by a break in the clouds - almost to the point of near totality. Lewis had been billed as the prime place in Britain to see the solar phenomenon. Caroline Pritchard, 58, and her partner Laurence McCallum, 50, travelled 905 miles in a 21 hour car and ferry journey - together with their three dogs - to see the event. This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness . 'This is the end of the age of Aquarius and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse,' said Mr McCallum, who works in a fine food business. 'I took the week off work unpaid and it has been worth it. It was fantastic. We arrived on Tuesday and unfortunately missed the other great astronomical event here this week - the Northern Lights. But the eclipse more than made up for it.' Ms Pritchard agreed: 'I am a spiritual person and I was drawn here to see the eclipse. I believe in powers greater than ourselves.' Islander Linda Vaughan, 62, from Crossbost, rang a Tibetan bowl to herald the eclipse as it created dusk - with temperatures noticeably plunging with the sun's infra red blocked out. 'The sound resonates with the stones. This is a spiritual and sacred place.. It is about creating the right harmony,' she said. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. Instead, solar eclipse glasses (shown) helped people observe the event . Four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with Kilda Cruises from Leverburgh on the Isle of Harris at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote St Kilda. The archipelago, 41 miles (66km) west of the main Outer Hebrides, was forecast to be cloud free at the time of the event. Donny Mackay, president of the Stornoway Astronomical Society, said it received over 500 inquiries by email - as well as 100 phone calls - from all over the UK as well as far away as Germany. 'I was a bit worried when I saw the cloud early this morning but it turned out as good as we could have hoped for. It was really memorable,' he said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning .\nBut several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun .\nThese were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields .\nThey are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares .\nAnd they can be more than ten times as big as Earth ."}]}

The group of 20 revellers from Wrexham in North Wales said they had paid more than £4,000 for the weekend break to Benidorm, in order to celebrate Wayne Roberts' wedding next month. After they made a male flight attendant cry, the pilot called the police and ordered the party to leave the plane - which was due to take off from Manchester Airport and fly to Alicante. Ryanair defended the decision and said it 'will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time.' A group of 20 men who were due to go on a stag do to Benidorm were thrown off a Ryanair flight after they boarded at Manchester, following claims their behaviour was 'disruptive.' The group claim they have lost £4,000 between them after they were forced to get off the plane and celebrate in Wrexham instead . The incident took place Friday, March 13, after the 20 strong group boarded the plane. Police were called, with some members of the group removed and others leaving voluntarily. One of the group, Chris Jones, 32, who lost around £200, said : 'We had a bite to eat and a beer and got on the plane. 'No one was drunk. We were not wearing stag T-shirts or being loud or offensive. We took our seats and were talking in groups, as you do. 'About five to ten minutes later, we heard a whisper the police had been called to kick someone off. We had no idea it was us. 'We had been joking around, saying how embarrassing it would be for the person, and the next thing the officers came up to us and asked us to leave.' They claim they received no warnings before being ordered off the flight. According to the group, a male steward said he 'couldn't cope' with them and broke down in tears. Mr Jones added: 'The police did try reasoning with him but the captain then came out and put his arm round the steward and said he wouldn't fly with us on board.' Ryanair backed the decision and said it would not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour on any of its flight . He claimed police told them to go and book another flight because they were not overly drunk but there were none left that evening. The group went back to Wrexham in an attempt to salvage the celebrations. The planned trip was meant to be similar to a previous stag party they had all gone on, when they travelled to Prague last year. It is understood every member of the party - including the 'devastated' groom, have now made formal complaints to the budget airline about their treatment. A spokesman for Ryanair denied the group was treated unfairly. He said: 'The crew of this flight from Manchester to Alicante requested police assistance prior to departure after a number of customers became disruptive during the boarding process. 'Police removed a number of individuals from the aircraft, while others disembarked voluntarily. 'Ryanair apologised to the other customers for the slight delay to their flight departure, but reaffirmed that the safety and comfort of its customers, crew and aircraft is its priority. 'Ryanair will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Officers attended and, as requested, the group left the aeroplane in a peaceful manner. 'No offences were committed.' British visitors on a Spanish news website backed the airline's tough action. Ken Devey wrote: 'Few beers down them and they forget they are not the only ones on board the flight. Good on Ryanair.' Another Briton, Steve, said : 'Quite right too.

Gordon, who tweeted that he gave Brown CPR after finding her in the tub, has complained via social media about not being allowed to see her. \"Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,\" Bobby Brown said last month in a statement through his lawyers. The terms were not revealed. \"In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers,\" lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. \"Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart.\" Gordon began living with Houston and her daughter after the superstar singer took him in when he was a teen. After her death, he and Bobbi Kristina became romantically involved. In a Facebook post on Friday, Bobbi Kristina's aunt Leolah Brown wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil, claiming that Gordon is being investigated by the police regarding what happened to her niece. \"If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded,\" she wrote. Gordon appears with his mother in the \"Dr. Phil\" clip, and the talk show host questions his sobriety. \"You've been drinking a lot though, right?\" Dr. Phil asks before telling Gordon, \"I want you to go straight to rehab.\" According to People, Gordon did check into rehab after filming. The episode is scheduled to air Wednesday."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gordon taped an episode of \"The Dr. Phil Show\" that airs this week .\nA clip shows him distraught over Bobbi Kristina Brown .\nHe has checked into rehab, People magazine reports ."}]}

Ornithologist David Lindo, who has featured on TV shows such as Countryfile, decided to promote his passion for conservation after discovering Britain is one of the few countries not to have its own national bird. While America has the bald eagle, Sweden the common blackbird, Japan the green pheasant, France the Gallic rooster and India the peacock, the author and broadcaster said it was hard to believe that, as a nation of animal lovers, Britain does not have a bird to call its own. Bird is the word: The robin (pictured), wren and blue tit have made it on to a shortlist to find Britain's national bird . The wren (left) and blue tit (right) are among the favourites to win the prize when voting ends on May 7 . More than 70,000 people voted for a British shortlist and there are now six weeks to choose which bird should represent the country. The ten most popular were the robin, kingfisher, barn owl, blue tit, wren, blackbird, puffin, mute swan, red kite and hen harrier. Will the Kingfisher be top of the tree after the vote? 1) Robin . 2) Kingfisher . 3) Barn owl . 4) Blue tit . 5) Wren . 6) Blackbird . 7) Puffin . 8) Mute swan . 9) Red kite . 10) Hen harrier . Mr Lindo said he will be speaking to the Government once the public has voted to see if the winner can officially be made Britain's national bird. He said: 'I want to encourage the great British public to vote for the bird that best represents all that is great about this nation. 'Along with the expected contenders - the friendly robin, charismatic puffin and elegant swan - there is one major surprise, the hen harrier, one of England's rarest breeding birds. 'Down to just one breeding pair a couple of years ago, it may already be extinct. Could the majestic hen harrier knock the hot favourite robin off its perch?'

And by Wednesday morning the 26-year-old dumped the singer via Twitter, writing: 'Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.' 'No baby drama for me,' the model and socialite concluded, breaking up with the troubled young man (once again) on the micro-blogging site. She's done: Karrueche Tran broke up with Chris Brown on Twitter on Wednesday, pictured on Tuesday, following claims he fathered a child with another woman . It is unclear if Brown, 25, was on a break during his tumultuous relationship with Karrueche when he allegedly fathered the nine-month-old child. When the news first broke on Tuesday, Karrueche was seen make-up free and looking downcast as she took her dog for a walk in Los Angeles. TMZ reported short after that Karrueche was 'blindsised' by the baby news, having no idea about he child. The model and socialite was casually dressed in sweats and trainers as she appeared a bit tired while clutching her cellphone and a pink dog leash. Dumped: The 26-year-old broke up with the singer once again via the micro-blogging site . A new dad? Brown, pictured on Monday in Atlanta, has fathered a nine-month-old baby with a model named Nia, according to TMZ . Brown's baby mama, according to TMZ, is an aspiring model and nursing student from Texas named Nia Amey. Pictures from the 31-year-old's modelling site see her topless as she describes herself as someone who is always up for adventure. The Hispanic Texan says in her modelling profile from 2009: 'My name is Nia Amey. I am a 25 year old aspiring model. Before the storm: Brown is pictured last month with on/off girlfriend of four years, Karrueche, who is not the mother of his young child . Happier time: The on-off pair pictured sitting front row at a NYFW runway show last month . 'I'm a full time nursing student and a very outgoing person. I love photography and always up for new adventures.' TMZ claims, Nia has 'known Chris for several years'. Sources connected to both Nia and Chris told the site they are 'on very good terms', however they are currently not dating. And perhaps adding insult to injury Karrueche has met Nia before.

The Loyal singer has been romantically liked to model Karrueche for the past four years. However the pair's relationship has always been rocky, and the pair have frequently split before reuniting. The pair were seen together last month, hand in hand at New York Fashion Week. But back in December, Chris launched a lengthy attack on his girlfriend via Instagram. Out and about: Karrueche, 26, was seen out with a friend in Studio City on Monday night . After pulling her up on only visiting him once during his four months in prison, he then accused her of 'going on dates with Drake'. He added: 'I made it clear to the world who my girl was and and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times. 'When this relationship first started u knew what it was and even participated in threesomes. I slowed all that s*** down.' Before dating Karrueche, Chris was in a relationship with singer Rihanna who he started dating in 2008. On February 8, 2009, an argument in the Deuces singer's car ended with a physical altercation that left the then-20-year-old Bajan beauty hospitalised with multiple contusions to her face. Chris, then just 19, turned himself in to police, where he was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats, before pleading not guilty at his arraignment. Forgiven: Chris was involved with singer Rihanna before his romance with Karreuche. They started dating in 2008, split in 2009 and briefly reunited in late 2012. They're seen at the 2013 Grammy Awards . On June 22, 2009, the star pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years' formal probation, and domestic violence counseling. Chris started dating model Karreuche in 2011 before splitting up in late 2012 when he became romantically involved with Riri again.

Dick Morris, who helped President Bill Clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own 'bimbo eruption' scandal, wrote Monday on his blog that Mrs. Clinton 'doesn’t know how to type.' 'That’s right. She writes everything out in longhand. Really. Anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads.' Morris' insights, although dated, came as the former secretary of state visited the White House for a rare sit-down with President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton visited the White House on Monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging President Obama, while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the Watergate tapes and said the Obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016 . PRESSURE: Clinton is facing tough questions about what's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as America's top diplomat . Former Clinton insidder Dick Morris has turned against Hillary, dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be . 'Her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick,' he predicted. 'She wouldn’t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters. No way. That’s why the Benghazi Committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that Hillary’s closest aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, maintained.' 'Anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf,' Morris continued. 'There’s a reason why Hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business: all the important emails were likely written by her staff. Without access to them, we won’t know what was going on.' A congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, while Clinton was secretary of state. The revelation that she exclusively used a private email account – otuside the control or automatic archiving of the Obama administration – has fed Republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover-up in the weeks before the 2012 election. At least two aides, Mills and Abedin, used personal email accounts on Clinton's private server, kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. Clinton's hour-long White House visit on Monday followed her appearance on a Washington, D.C. domestic policy panel hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress, and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists. She took no questions from reporters at the evening event, even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage, her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks. At the earlier liberal event, she endorsed a German-style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed. 'President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching up in . person when their schedules permit,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday in a cryptic statement to reporters. 'This afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the . White House and discussed a range of topics.' Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging Obama in the White House Situation Room. The president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the Democratic presidential nomination. IT'S THE AIDES, STUPID! Email accounts of former State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (left) and her top deputy Huma Abedin (right) are where Benghazi-related emails likely lurk, says Dick Morris . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in Kenya and lacked a valid U.S. birth certificate. The resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since Day One. Clinton's Twitter message, though, defended key provisions of the president's signature health insurance overhaul, which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president. 'Repeal those things? Embrace them!' she tweeted. Morris has a checkered past. He famously resigned from Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign two months before Election Day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president. His most recent star turn came with a lengthy Fox News Channel contract which wasn't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest. Mitt Romney, the once famous pollster predicted, would coast to victory and unseat Obama. But Morris has been a thorn in Hillary's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996. YUK-YUK: Clinton joked about her email scandal on Monday night at a journalism award dinnner: ''No more secrecy, no more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that do me?' When she ran for president in 2008, he penned a vicious 'fact check' article claiming that her 'main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.' 'Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party,' for a year after her college graduation, he wrote. And 'she flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar.' Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he said Sunday on a New York talk radio program that 'when we talk about \"Will Hillary survive the email scandal?\" – it’s just like asking in 1973 and 74, \"Will Nixon survive the Watergate tapes?\"' 'By delaying the day of reckoning' for all her private emails, he said, 'she's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy, but the entire [Democratic] Party.' 'I think Obama wants [Elizabeth] Warren, not Hillary,' Morris added. 'I think the reason the email scandal got released to the newspapers by the administration was because they wanted to torpedo Hillary.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dick Morris writes that the former secretary of state writes everything in longhand .\nIt's her closest aides, he says, whose email accounts must be scoured for hints about the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks .\nMorris was a close Clinton adviser but resigned in 1996 after a prostitution scandal in which he let a hooker listen to his phone calls with Bill Clinton .\nHillary visited with Obama at the White House on Monday, later tweeting an old photo of her hugging him in the White House Situation Room .\nMorris said he believes the White House created her email scandal in order to 'torpedo' her chances at claiming the presidency ."}]}

At 6ft 4in, Chelsea and England centre-back Gary Cahill ought to be hard to miss, especially when he is the national team’s vice-captain, having picked up pretty much every club honour in the game. Win the Premier League in May and he will have the full set - following Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup success in little more than three years. Yet he goes relatively unnoticed while the likes of John Terry, or his old Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard, both with similar achievements to their name, would be stopped in their tracks. Gary Cahill went relatively unnoticed during an interview with the Mail on Sunday at the Pennyhill Park hotel . Chelsea defender Cahill has picked up nearly every club honour in the game, including the Champions League . ‘If you’d said to me four or five years ago I would be in this position I’d have snapped your hands off,’ says Cahill, 29. ‘It’s an amazing feeling. I often think about how lucky I am and how so many people would love to be in this position.’ Since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Bolton in January 2012, the medals and trophies have simply kept on coming. ‘Moving to Chelsea has been such a success in terms of the titles I have won in three years,’ he says. ‘The winning mentality of the club rubs off on the players and you just want to win even more.’ Cahill poses with the Champions League trophy and the FA Cup after Chelsea completed the double in 2012 . The former Bolton and Aston Villa centre back holds aloft the Europa League trophy in Amsterdam a year later . A week ago, Cahill added a Capital One Cup winner’s medal as Chelsea clinched the first major silverware of season in a 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Wembley. ‘It was almost like the lads were bouncing into training the following day,’ he recalls. ‘Winning anything is special to [Jose] Mourinho. It’s his first trophy since he returned. ‘There was very little celebration considering we had just won a competition. My family had come down from the north to watch the game and they all stayed at my house. There’s no better feeling than driving home from Wembley to my family at home.’ Cahill added the Capital One Cup trophy to his haul last week as Chelsea defeated Tottenham 2-0 at Wembley . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is all smiles as he and his team celebrate after landing their latest silverware . Cahill (centre) appears highly amused as Mourinho throws himself to the floor during the celebrations . But with the Champions League and Barclays Premier League high on Chelsea’s agenda, it is ‘back to business’ as Cahill says. Mourinho keeps stoking up the warrior-like instincts in his team and Cahill believes that, aside from the manager’s meticulous pre-match planning, two key elements are contributing to the team’s success this season. ‘We’ve learned from our experiences,’ he says. ‘We played several teams last season where people expected us to get results but we didn’t. Having that in the back of your mind going into the season has helped, you don’t want to go through that again — you don’t want to waste opportunities.’ The second key factor is the quality of signings who joined the club in the past two transfer windows — including Cesc Fabregas and one of the best strikers in Europe, Diego Costa. Cahill says Chelsea learnt from setbacks last season and insists the club do not want to waste opportunities . Diego Costa arrived at Chelsea from Atletico Madrid and is one of the Premier League's most-feared strikers . Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, signed from Barcelona, has formed a connection with Costa . ‘Diego has come in and although he hardly speaks any English, had never played in this league before and has never lived in this country, he had an impact from the word go. ‘Time and again players come over and take a long time to settle down and get into the groove of the Premier League but it hasn’t fazed him. He’s one of the liveliest jokers in the changing room. He’s certainly entertaining and he has settled into the group really well. ‘With Cesc, everyone knew his quality and he has played in this League before so in a way it was easy for him to come back. But still, he has come into the side like he has never been away and the connection Costa and Fabregas have had this season has been fantastic for us. ‘There’s also the likes of Filipe Luis, who has come in and done tremendously well. There’s a real fight on at left-back. It’s one of those positions where we’re blessed. You know whoever plays is going to do the job. ‘Kurt Zouma is another great talent, he listens to everybody and he takes on advice. He’s a nice lad and a fantastic player. Playing at a club like Chelsea and being given the opportunity to play with the world-class players that we have means you can learn from them and improve your game.’ Chelsea centre backs Gary Cahill, captain John Terry and  Kurt Zouma celebrate together at Wembley . Cahill had to take some flak after Tottenham’s Harry Kane inspired a 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year’s Day, but he takes such criticism as ‘part and parcel of the game,’ and points out that ‘there isn’t a footballer on the planet who hasn’t received negative press’ at some stage in their career. ‘You need to have a thick skin at times, especially at the highest level. I am constantly analysing my performances and I tend to focus more on things I haven’t done as well as I’d have liked. I always look to improve and that’s what’s got me to where I am today.’ Cahill’s greatest day in Chelsea colours came in the Champions League victory over Bayern Munich in 2012. Now he is playing his part in their bid to repeat the feat, and his magnificently timed flick, from a Terry cross, led to Branislav Ivanovic’s header putting Chelsea in front against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their last 16 tie last month. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates after scoring for Chelsea against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League . Cahill's flick from Terry's cross at the Parc des Princes led to Ivanovic's important goal in the French capital . ‘It was a crazy situation because we found all three of us in the box and nobody else,’ recalls Cahill. ‘JT played it to me and I knew Ivanovic was coming in behind me. I couldn’t score from that angle so I tried to help it on and he did the rest.’ On Wednesday, Chelsea host PSG in the return leg, with the tie 1-1, and it’s a mouthwatering challenge. ‘It’s got that final-feel about it because if you lose the game you’re out — and you have to really push hard to win the game. The atmosphere on European nights is something special and that’s another positive with the second leg being played at home, the fans are our 12th man. Have we got the squad and the players to win it again? Yes we have.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gary Cahill has won Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea .\nThe defender has also landed the FA Cup and Capital One Cup with Blues .\nEngland vice-captain could complete set with Premier League title ."}]}

The initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like Americorps, Habitat for Humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry, where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at Millennials. Chelsea Clinton and late night host Jimmy Kimmel teamed up Monday in Los Angeles to push for Serve a Year -- an initiative that urges high school and college graduates to serve their communities for a year after graduating . 'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton said . 'It's great to see so many people, especially young people, dedicating yourselves to public service because you care about people and not because a court ordered you to,' Kimmel joked at the Serve a Year launch in Los Angeles on Monday. 'The goal of this mission is essentially to put less focus on yourself and put more focus on others,' he said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Over the next three years, ServiceNation hopes that mission will be accomplished by portraying the perks of service in television and movies, according to the Serve A Year website. Their hope is that, with the help of partners like Comcast, Airbnb and the Clinton Foundation, non-profits like Habitat for Humanity, Teach for America and Americorps will have both added resources and new recruits after word spreads about the merits of serving a year. Leveraging Hollywood: The initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like Americorps, Habitat for Humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry, where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at Millennials . 'We know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities, and so I think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today,' Clinton told the Hollywood Reporter. 'In order to reach millennials, we need to go where they already are, and the entertainment industry has the megaphone and audience to help us get the word out and change the cultural expectation of what it means to grow up in America.' Executive director of ServiceNation, Zach Maurin, told KABC the year of service comes with a paycheck and a scholarship. 'This is about giving them the skills and experiences they need, so they can support themselves while they're helping to change peoples' lives,' Maurin said.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a news summarization assistant. Create concise, accurate summaries of news articles that capture the key information in a journalistic style."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this article:\n\n(CNN)Earlier this month, Shahindokht Molaverdi, Iran's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, led an official delegation to the United Nations in New York to attend the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In her March 11 speech to the commission, Molaverdi said that \"the Islamic Republic of Iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status...on its agenda.\" Molaverdi described the significant progress Iranian women have made in education and science, citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women's rights. There was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including Iran's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving Iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment. Unfortunately, Molaverdi's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality. On the day she delivered her speech, Amnesty International released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before Iran's parliament that would further restrict women's rights. One would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed \"traditional\" families in society. The other would \"further entrench gender-based discrimination, particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children,\" Amnesty said. A day later, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, released his fourth report to the U.N. Human Rights Council describing the dire state of human rights in the country. His report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that Human Rights Watch and others had raised during Iran's 2014 Universal Periodic Review, a review of every U.N. state's human rights record every four years by the Human Rights Council. The sobering reality, all too familiar to Molaverdi, is that Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators. The proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women's rights in recent years. To many, the discrepancy between what Molaverdi said in her speech, and what women face in Iran, smacked of diplomatic subterfuge. Activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women's rights in Iran, and called out Molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that Iranian women face. Yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that Molaverdi, who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women's rights at home, and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for Iran's beleaguered rights activists. Just two days before the U.N. session, Iran's conservative Kayhan daily, thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, published an article that showed just what Iran's women's rights activists are up against. The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U.N. commission, describing its notion of \"gender equality\" as \"unacceptable to the Islamic Republic.\" The article accused Molaverdi of \"negligence\" for participating in events that could damage Iran's reputation and interests, and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran's security and intelligence agencies. What's striking about Kayhan's attack is that Iran's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups, including women's rights activists. Groups like the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women, were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious \"national security\" grounds. But those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting. Anyone who fails, willingly or unknowingly, to heed their threats may face reprisals, as several activists who attempted to attend similar U.N. events in previous years found out. Yet Kayhan's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women's groups in Iran as they continue to challenge the state's monopoly on the women's rights narrative. While Iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution, their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education, health care, and birth control. The image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by Iran's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many Iranian women today. So while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what Molaverdi said at the United Nations, and what Iranian women face, let us not lose sight of another reality: the paradox that exists in Iran between the state's regressive laws and policies against women, and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied. That effort, at the very least, deserves our respect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Faraz Sanei : Women's groups in Iran have remained adaptable .\nThose hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting, she says ."}]}

Welcome to the world: A mother Polar bear introduces her two newborn cubs to the joys of playing in the snow . Tumble: It takes time to learn to keep your balance! Wildlife photographer Andy Skillen spent two days following the bears at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada . Drowsy: According to Mr Skillen, the polar bears had recently resurfaced after spending the winter in hibernation . The area is famous for its polar bear dens, and Mr Slkillen managed to capture a set of heart-warming scenes. In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February. The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw. Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side. 'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief.

Nick Gardner from Perth ensemble San Cisco was on a friend's farm taking some time out last week to hunt pests when the unfortunate incident occurred. The band member was with a friend near the West Australian town of Collie, about 200 kilometres south of Perth, when they were driving through rough terrain and the gun went off. The bass player in Perth band San Cisco has ruled himself out of the first leg of the band's upcoming tour after he literally shot himself in the foot . 'As we were driving through an exceptionally rough paddock, I reached down to stop the gun from bouncing around and before I knew it, it had gone off,' Gardner said. 'The bolt had slid down and the jolting had triggered the gun. Somewhat of a freak accident. I realised I had been shot and ripped off my boot and sock to reveal a hole in my foot and blood everywhere. Gardner then explained the mate he was with, Isaac, quickly jumped into action grabbing his first aid kit and bandaging his friend's foot up.

Surrounding the referee, complaining about decisions, elbows, and intimidation. Save for the poor result, it had all the hallmarks of a Mourinho classic. However, if the histrionics start to outweigh performances the Portuguese has a habit of losing favour fast. It’s what killed his reign at Real Madrid. Jose Mourinho shows his frustrations during Chelsea's match against PSG on Wednesday night . Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers and demand a red card is shown to Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Ibrahimovic (right) gets up as nine Chelsea players surround him and the referee after the incident . One of the battles Mourinho fought at Real was with the club’s own match delegate Miguel Porlan. ‘Chendo’, as he is known to everyone, played for over a decade at right-back for Madrid before continuing to serve the club after hanging up his boots. As part of the staff allowed to sit on the bench during games alongside goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, fitness coach Rui Faria, and Mourinho’s No 2 and current Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka, Chendo soon became part of the systematic applying of pressure on the fourth official. It was understood that Mourinho liked his assistants to rotate the badgering of match officials so to limit the likelihood any one individual would be sent off. Chendo, who respected – and was respected by – Mourinho, thought the tactic was below a club like Real Madrid. Spanish daily El Pais claimed he told his manager as much saying: ‘We don’t do that kind of thing here’, and also suggested it was common knowledge among the players that Chendo hated the role so much he would often approach the fourth official and appear to remonstrate with him when really he was just asking him if he had the time, or if knew what time Madrid’s big department store El Corte Inglés opened in the morning. Mourinho (centre) talks with Real Madrid delegate Miguel 'Chendo' Porlan during a La Liga match in 2010 . Nemanja Matic (centre) appeals to the referee following Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar during the first half . Chelsea players later look dejected as they are knocked out of the Champions League round of 16 . Mourinho has always believed matches are won not just by the eleven on the pitch but by everyone at the club. And neither are they just won with football. If the opposition can be intimidated and bullied – and if that affects their ability to play – then that serves the end-game goal of victory. Mourinho’s ‘us against them’ battle plan at Madrid lasted three years. It left many at the club burned-out and almost relieved when it was replaced by the calm bought by Carlo Ancelotti, but it cannot be said that it did not bring trophies. It’s true that he never reached the Champions League final at the club but he did win the Spanish Cup in his first season and La Liga in his second. That might have been small fare in any other era but against the best Barcelona team in history it can’t be seen that way. The third season at the Bernabeu that produced no trophies came when there were perhaps more dissenting voices inside the dressing room than there were players prepared to do it Jose’s way. The key to Mourinho’s success is that everybody rows to the same rhythm – once a couple of galley members have downed oars there are problems. Mourinho (right) argues with the referee as Cristiano Ronaldo (left) looks on during a match in April 2013 . Real Madrid players look on as Mourinho (left) is involved in an argument with the referee during the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona . On the pitch players often had to curtail their instincts to try to just out-play the opposition by surrendering to an overall plan to out-strategize them too. The beginnings of the fall-outs with Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos came because they believed, having won the World Cup with Spain, they could match Barcelona for football. Others, such as Xabi Alonso, sided with Mourinho believing that they would never out-play Pep Guardiola’s team and they had to be cleverer. Part of Mourinho’s belief that it would take more than just football to beat Barca came from his experience at Inter. They beat Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League on their way to beating Bayern Munich in the final but they did it with their centre-forward at full-back as an early sending off for Thiago Motta left them with most of the game having to play with 10 men. His victory jig on the pitch that night interrupted only by the Nou Camp sprinklers and Victor Valdes trying to usher him off the pitch is one of the images of his career and it set the tone for his time at Madrid but it didn’t always work. In Mourinho’s first season, and just after one of his greatest triumphs with Real beating Barca in the Copa del Rey final 1-0 courtesy of a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, Barcelona and Madrid were drawn together again in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Ronaldo (back) leaps high to score the winning goal in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . Real Madrid players celebrate with the trophy after winning La Liga in the season of 2011-12 . The players were flying believing that after their cup final success they now had the measure of Barcelona. But Mourinho thought otherwise and set his team up in the first leg at the Bernabeu to not lose. They would defend stubbornly and in numbers and frustrate Barcelona before going for them in the latter stages of the match. If they scored a late goal to put them ahead in the tie then perfect; if not then a 0-0 would be a good result to take back to the Nou Camp where without an away goal and bound to go on the attack, Barca would leave themselves open on the break. Ronaldo was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing Barcelona’s defenders. The rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position. Ronaldo looks dejected as he leaves the field after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League in 2011 . The plan may well have worked to perfection but Pepe was sent off in the second half after clashing with Dani Alves and against 10 men Messi scored twice to leave Real with no chance in the second leg. Mourinho recovered his players’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in Spain. Opinion is still divided over his legacy. One television station in Spain suggested this week that Mourinho was among three candidates to replace Ancelotti along with Zinedine Zidane and Jurgen Klopp. Others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return. The purists tut-tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of Barcelona’s 20-pass moves to goal. But it worked because Madrid and Mourinho won. It’s when it no longer works - as it didn’t for Chelsea on Wednesday - is it really called into question."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last-16 by PSG .\nWednesday's match had all the hallmarks of a Jose Mourinho classic .\nThere were similar histrionics during his reign at Real Madrid .\nMiguel 'Chendo' Porlan thought the tactic was below the Spanish club .\nOpinion is still divided in Spain over Mourinho's legacy at Real Madrid .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Chelsea news ."}]}

The game's still going on'. That's not me making a mess of Kenneth Wolstenholme's infamous words from Wembley in 1966 when the boys in red won the World Cup. That was Jonathan Pearce's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some Villa fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team's semi-final at home to West Brom. Of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see. Except that they very nearly were. Because they were a hare's breath from what we saw when Geoff Hurst went through to make it 4-2. Only time surely makes that a less controversial incident? Aston Villa fans invaded the pitch after their FA Cup win over West Brom on Saturday night and are seen taunting the away supporters as a line of police keeps them apart . Thousands stream onto the pitch after the match, which was moved to Saturday evening by the BBC . Geoff Hurst races through to score England's fourth goal in the 1966 World Cup final with West Germany . The FA Cup is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre. And attendances may well have endorsed that. But this season, with the FA succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the BBC and BT, the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life. The kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great Cup days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch. Not that that makes that group of Villa fans' behaviour justifiable. Although you might debate that a Midland derby that doesn't kick-off until Saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response? But the timing was because, I can only assume, the slots were preordained for the BBC to include Saturday and Monday evenings. While BT had Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoon. And with the Beeb having first dibs on that deal. Or in other words, Auntie had what they'd consider would be the ideal ties, with which to ensure the biggest possible audience, at the best possible times in their schedule. BBC presenter Gary Lineker and pundits Jermaine Jenas and Alan Shearer watch the pitch invasion . Monday night's line-up for the Manchester United vs Arsenal featured Roy Keane, Alan Shearer and Ian Wright alongside Gary Lineker in the Old Trafford studio . BT Sport's team of (from left) Jake Humphrey, Paul Jewell, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman with the FA Cup pitchside at Bradford City vs Reading on Saturday . This was a situation BT Sport decided to create a silk purse from. Why hadn't we'd been following this season's giant killers Bradford, a nation had cried, having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits? Well, on Saturday lunchtime, BT went free to air to answer that call and show us this season's favourite Davids in action live against the Goliaths of...Reading. OK, not a hell of a mismatch, but Bradford were still a great story. Unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig's ear on Bradford City's pitch. Indeed, such a vision in mud it was, it required the club to provide BT with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth. Nevertheless, there it was, an old school FA Cup that we could all watch, for nothing, and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage Cup season. By way of a precursor for the new Premier League telly deal, this sense of occasion rolled on into Monday night. Again, this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad. Danny Welbeck celebrates his winner for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night . Scott Sinclair is mobbed by Aston Villa supporters after scoring against West Brom . Not to mention some fans from North London who would have had to make their way back from Lancashire by any means necessary on a school night. But again, if you look at the bigger picture, it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the Cup. And a formidable old pro line up of Roy Keane, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright and Martin Keown alongside Gary Lineker all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event. Next up, more disruption for four teams whose replayed games will be shoe horned in to fit nicely for us folks at home. regardless of how it affects their League schedules. Dermot O'Leary reacts after Peter Schmeichel draws Arsenal to play Bradford City or Reading in the semis . But I echo Dermot O'Leary's cry of 'woohooh' when he drew his team Arsenal's ball for the semi final draw against either Bradford or Reading. Yes, it has lacked a certain sense of tradition. Yes, it has occasionally proven awkward for certain clubs, and their fans. And yes it provided that unsavoury moment at Villa Park. But I celebrate the fact that the FA Cup has been put back in the forefront of our football thinking. And if it is because the BBC and BT have decided between themselves to make it their own, then I'll live with the negatives and embrace the positive."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BBC and BT Sport shared coverage of weekend's FA Cup quarter-finals .\nAston Villa vs West Brom was marred by pitch invasion at final whistle .\nMany blamed the BBC for scheduling the game on Saturday evening .\nArsenal fans also faced travel chaos with Man United tie at Old Trafford .\nBT Sport didn't get a goal in either of their quarter-final matches .\nBut both have revitalised a competition that had lost its lustre ."}]}

Bush (2011 photo) Appearance: Former President George W. Bush sat between his wife Laura Bush and First Lady Michelle Obama in Selma, Alabama, on Saturday . Nash later said in the interview she made the choice 'when it was apparent that he was going to be part of it. I think the Selma movement was about non-violence and peace and democracy.' She continued, claiming 'And George Bush stands for just the opposite, for violence, and war, and stolen elections.' NewsOne Now reported that Nash 'is widely considered the architect of many of King’s campaigns, and one of the only women in his inner circle.' Tessa Thompson played Nash in the 2014 film Selma, the website pointed out. Nash was a leader in the Freedom Riders movement, having been one of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founders and the Nashville Student Movement Ride coordinator,PBS reported. Nash recently told WLS that she and James Bevel, to whom she was married at the time, 'tried for several months to persuade Martin King and Andy Young, who was the executive director of [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] at the time, to go into Alabama on a voting project and we were not successful. 'It always seemed to be some type of thing that needed to be done right away. So Jim and I decided that he would take the car and some of his staff and start organizing. It was a big sacrifice for me because I was expecting a baby and had a toddler at the time.' She told the television station that the pair couple drafted the first plan for the Selma voting rights movement after a 1963 church bombing which killed four children. Nash told WLS 'I never considered Dr. King my leader. I always considered myself at his side and I considered him at my side. I was going to do what the spirit told me to do. So If I had a leader, that was my leader.' History: The events of 'Bloody Sunday' prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act. King is seen here at the March 26, 1965 march in Selma . On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared the work of the Civil Rights Movement advanced but unfinished  during a visit to the Alabama bridge that spawned a landmark voting law. Obama, the first black U.S. president, said discrimination by law enforcement officers in Ferguson, Missouri, showed a lot of work needed to be done on race in America, but he warned it was wrong to suggest that progress had not been made. 'Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer,' Obama said, standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where police and state troopers beat and fired tear gas at peaceful marchers who were advocating against racial discrimination at the voting booth. The event became known as 'Bloody Sunday' and prompted a follow-up march led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that spurred the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 'The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office, but they led a nation,' Obama said. 'What they did here will reverberate through the ages ... because they proved that nonviolent change is possible.' After his remarks, Obama and his wife Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, and mother-in-law Marian Robinson joined some of the original marchers along with former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, to walk across the bridge. Commemoration: Obama is seen hugging Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who was at the 'Bloody Sunday' march 50 years ago . The marchers sang songs including 'We Shall Overcome' as a crowd of some 40,000 people looked on. The anniversary comes at a time of renewed focus on racial disparities in the United States, including discrimination from police against black citizens nationwide. Obama condemned the city of Ferguson on Friday for 'oppressive and abusive' actions against black residents that were revealed in a U.S. Justice Department report accusing police and court officials of racial bias. On Saturday, he criticized efforts to limit voting rights that have sparked a clash between Republicans and Democrats across the country. 'Right now, in 2015, fifty years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote. As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed,' he said. 'Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence ... stands weakened.' Rev. Raphael Warnock, the 45-year-old pastor of the Atlanta church led by King at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, lamented that the measure was now in limbo. 'I'm glad to see a parade of politicians here, but two years later we still are waiting on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act,' he said. 'You can't celebrate lessons of history from one period while standing on the wrong side of history today.' Others reflected on how much had changed since the violence of a bygone era. 'Fifty years ago if we were standing here we would be surprised if a police officer did not beat us,' said Dick Gregory, 83, who was on the bridge 50 years before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Diane Nash has said that she didn't participate in a march across the Edmund Pettus bridge  on Saturday because of the former president .\nShe's said she made the choice 'when it was apparent that he was going to be part of it .\nNash was a leader in the Freedom Riders movement .\nShe and her and her husband at the time James Bevel drafted the first plan for the Selma voting rights movement ."}]}

The men were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill.

Oliver Miles, the former ambassador to Libya, said Mr Blair was the 'wrong man' who had 'not been able to do the job'. Other critics branded Mr Blair's role a 'fig leaf' and said his role in the Iraq War made it impossible for him to do the job. Tony Blair achieved little in his role as Middle East envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region, a former British diplomat has said . He said the role, as the representative of the Quartet of the UN, the EU, Russia and the US, was a 'convenient excuse for doing nothing' and that was what he had achieved. Mr Blair has been the envoy for the four peace negotiators since shortly after he stepped down as Prime Minister in 2007. In that time, the Office of the Quartet Representative has received a total of £20million in funding, mostly from the US and EU. Mr Blair is not paid for the role. His office did not confirm the reports yesterday that he was planning to 'step back' from the job. It is thought an announcement is due later this week. There was no official reaction to the speculation about his change of role yesterday in Europe or the US, and Downing Street refused to comment on the speculation. A Downing Street spokesman would say only that the former PM had been 'important work as the quartet's representative.' Oliver Miles, a former British diplomat, said: 'I think he's the wrong man and I also think it's the wrong job' But Mr Miles was damning about Mr Blair's role, and of the suggestion he could take on a 'wider role' in the region. The job was, he said, a 'convenient excuse for doing nothing'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think he's not been able to do the job. I think he's the wrong man and I also think it's the wrong job.' 'He was appointed I think it was the day he ceased to be British Prime Minister and it struck me at the time as a very strange appointment in many ways. I'm surprised he accepted it frankly.' Asked if he was saying Mr Blair should play no role in the region, he said: 'Yes I am. I think it's a mistake. He's the wrong man. I find it hard to believe, frankly, that the British Government would support him having a wider role. 'I find it even harder to believe that the Russians, who are also members of the Quartet, would support him having a wider role. 'I'm afraid if they do the reason is simply that he is a convenient excuse for doing nothing and that's been the case over the eight years that we've seen him in that. 'The Quartet has not achieved anything and Tony Blair as its representative has achieved very, very little.' Tory MP Crispin Blunt said Mr Blair's decision was 'well overdue.' 'His effectiveness was ended almost as soon as he was appointed when he wasn't allowed to do the politics, he was only allowed to do the economics of the Middle East peace process. 'Frankly it was a waste of time, he never had the mandate from the Quartet to achieve peace.' Andrew Mackinlay, the former Labour MP and former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee said Mr Blair's position was 'always a fig leaf'. He was disqualified from day one from fulfilling the role of peace envoy because of Iraq – which runs like a vein through all conflicts in the Middle East.' Mr Blair has been the envoy for the UN, the EU, Russia and the US since shortly after he stepped down as Prime Minister in 2007 . On Sunday a Financial Times report said Mr Blair was planning to 'step back' from the job and in negotiations to 'recast' his role while remaining involved in the peace process. He is thought to have met John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, recently to discuss a possible job change. It follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Mr Blair's role in peace negotiations in the Middle East and his business pursuits. Sources told the FT that Mr Blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable. There is also mounting unease in the US and EU over his poor relations with senior Palestinian Authority figures. Mr Blair does not disclose his clients, but they have included countries such as Peru, Colombia, Kuwait, Vietnam and Kazakhstan. His corporate roster has featured PetroSaudi, an oil company with links to the Saudi royal family, finance firm JP Morgan and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi wealth fund. Senior diplomats told the Financial Times Mr Blair was being eased out. They said: 'It is long overdue. He has been ineffective in this job. He has no credibility in this part of the world.' A senior source in the US administration said: 'Our position is clear. Tony Blair has been a valued partner in trying to bring peace to the Middle East and we will continue to value his input and support.' Last year, a group of former British ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-Prime Minister to be removed from his role as Middle East envoy, raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and attempts to 'absolve himself' of responsibility for the Iraq crisis. David Cameron's official spokesman said yesterday: 'I have seen the reports that Mr Blair may be considering a revised role. 'He has been doing an important role as the quartet representative since the second half of 2007. In terms of his own approach to how he thinks he may be best able to make a contribution, that is principally a matter for Tony Blair.

News broke earlier this week that the Mad Men star had just completed a 30 day stint in rehab at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut. The 44-year-old said on Wednesday, ‘Life throws a lot at you sometimes and you have to deal with it as much as you can,’ in an interview with Australian magazine TV Week. After treatment: Jon Hamm completed a 30-day stint in rehab, his rep announced on Tuesday; here he is pictured at LAX airport the same day . When the publication asked him if the life of an actor, where he is often challenged to inhabit dark characters, played a role in his alcoholism he was not entirely dismissive of the notion. 'I've said in varying ways that acting can be a difficult endeavour,' Hamm admitted, 'certainly not as difficult as the recent example I used of being a baby heart surgeon.' ‘But,' he added, 'it does present its own challenges and so does life.’ Just after he checked out: Hamm attended a special screening of Mad Men on Saturday in New York City with the cast of the hit AMC show; here he is pictured with January Jones . One step at a time: Jon was seen heading home in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Staying busy: The same day, he suited up and flashed a smile while celebrating the final episode of Mad Men with the Black & Red Ball in LA . The question was raised as his character Don Draper on Mad Men is not only plagued by personal demons but is a heavy drinker. But Hamm was quick to note how fortunate he felt to have supportive family and friends by his side as he faces his own personal struggles. A rep for the star told TMZ on Tuesday 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. 'They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward.' The facility: The Mad Men actor received treatment at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut for alcohol abuse . Inside Silver Hill: Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates . She has helped him: Hamm's publicist told the site, 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon  recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward'; here the couple is seen in December . On Tuesday he was spotted at LAX looking well dressed in a white double-breasted coat, black cardigan, grey trousers and black boots. He was also wearing a full beard, sunglasses and a hat. It is not known if Hamm has been in rehab before. His Mad Men character Don Draper was known for heavy drinking. The Silver Hill Hospital is a psychiatric hospital that was established in 1931. The facility provides comprehensive psychiatric and addiction treatment services. The campus sits on 42 acres and the buildings have a New England style to them. Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates. His character enjoyed cocktails: Don Draper often drank alcohol; here Hamm is pictured with Mad Men co-star Jessica Paré as they both hold up drinks . Raising a glass: The enigmatic advertising executive is famed for his love of booze . Bottom's up: Don celebrates with a glass of the hard stuff in sixties based drama Mad Men . Speaking to Esquire in 2014, Jon revealed his sisters once encouraged him to see a therapist following the death of his mother from a brain aneurysm. 'I had no concept of what that even meant,' he said. 'I’m a 20-year-old idiot, in the Midwest. This is not Woody Allen New York. We don’t sit around and talk about our feelings. We certainly don’t sit around and compare shrinks.' 'I went to the lady. Sat down and talked to the lady. I gotta say, it helps. Talking to anybody helps. Talking to your friends helps. But your friends are your friends. They’ll tell you what you want to hear. 'The shrink doesn’t sugarcoat it: \"Hey, you’re f***ed up. Do this, this and this. Don’t do this any more.\" It’s a wonderful third-person perspective that you get from an analyst. It’s invaluable, I think.' On the move: The 44-year-old actor was seen dressed in layers as he walked through the airport . Work ahead: Jon had a guest starring role on Tina Fey's Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . He added that his performances as tormented advertising executive Don are based on personal experience. He said:  'I hope that lends a deeper resonance. It’s not anything I’m doing consciously. All we can do as actors is bring our own personal experience to the role. 'My mother died when I was ten, so I did have far more experience of being raised outside my family than I had from my own home, probably.' The right scruff! The Bridesmaids star is sporting a generous amount of facial hair that evokes a far more rugged image than his Mad Men Don Draper character . In an interview with the Mail On Sunday in 2012, the actor admitted that his parallels with heavy drinker Don stopped at the character's love of  hard liquor. ‘I don’t drink as much as Don Draper,’he said. ‘I would be unconscious if I did.’ He also revealed to suffering from 'clinical depression' following the sudden death of his father when he was 20. 'I very much knew what the idea of permanence was by that point. I dropped out of school, moved into the basement of my older half-sister Julie’s house, enrolled in a local college and sank into depression,' he said. An end: Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season beginning on April 5 as the AMC drama airs its final episodes . ‘It was the classic definition of clinical depression; you want to stay in bed all day, you sleep till four o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t have any drive to get up and do anything. It was rough: it stinks. 'Other people who are better than me at putting thoughts into words describe it as a black cloud that descends on you. You become numb. You feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to take any step towards solving your situation.' Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season, which begins on April 5. He earned a Best Actor  Golden Globe Award in 2008 for his role. Ready to promote the show: On Monday the star was seen with his cast again on the Today show in NYC . Since wrapping the series in July, Jon had a guest starring role in Tina Fey's uproarious Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Jon played Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, a doomsday preacher who lures four women into an underground bunker for years after convincing them of an impending apocalypse - but they are later rescued. The Office alum Ellie Kemper plays the title character opposite Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane and Jane Krakowski. 'I was very glad they asked me to be a part of it,' he revealed to The Daily Beast. 'Ellie Kemper is a really nice person, and I felt honored to be able to play in the sandbox with the cool kids again.' Incredibly, Jon was 34-year-old Ellie's eighth grade teacher in 1993 after he graduated from the University of Missouri with an English degree and taught acting class at the same school he attended years earlier, John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri. Heavy drinker: Jon told the Mail On Sunday in 2012 that he would be 'unconscious' if he consumed as much alcohol as Don . 'I remember walking the red carpet at the Emmys and seeing Ellie there and going, \"You're here, too! This is so great!\"' Speaking to GQ in a recent interview, Jon expressed fear about finding work after his run on Mad Men. 'Look, the one constant thing I've had in my career is now removed,' he said. 'And that's an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? 'What's next? And I don't know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan.' Different times: Don flourishes in an age where heavy drinking and smoking are encouraged .

'We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,' said Trump, who is considering a bid for the Republican nomination. Trump spoke at the home of New Hampshire state Rep. Steve Stepanek. Although Trump's critics say he would bring an unflattering and circus-like atmosphere to Republican politics, many people in the crowd said they appreciate the reality TV star's willingness to say exactly what he thinks. PRESIDENT 'THE DONALD'? Trump is shaking all the right hands in New Hampshire, an important early primary state, as he makes the case that he should run for the White House . I'M HIRING MYSELF: Trump was stumping for other candidates but his political operatives have told Daily Mail Online that he's serious about self-financing a his own campaign . 'A man that has the ability to handle the press, play with them and hold his ground, I have tremendous respect for that,' said Lori Davis, vice president of the GOP committee in Weare. 'He's not afraid.' Trump has repeatedly flirted with a presidential run, but he has recently begun hiring staff in early voting states, including New Hampshire. He did not stop to speak with reporters after the event Thursday but said as he got into a black SUV that he has a 'better chance than anybody' of beating former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic favorite for the nomination. Trump shook a few hands as he headed toward the door rather than staying to mingle with the crowd of state lawmakers and activists. Earlier in the day, he attended private meetings with a group of New Hampshire veterans and Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas. Trump's pitch to the crowd centered on his career as a businessman. Unlike some of his potential Republican rivals, he said, he would not cut entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicaid. 'I would make this country so rich that you wouldn't have to cut it,' he said. HILLARY WHO? He said he's the best-positioned Republican to send Hillary Clinton packing in 2016 . Trump also suggested to the crowd that Wall Street financiers – he called many of them 'horrible people' – would negotiate better on the world stage than existing U.S. diplomats. His comments reflected the brash style that many in the audience said they'd like to see more of in Washington. 'I not only like it, I admire it,' said Randy Heller, an independent voter from Barrington.

It may also purchase more brainpower. A study found the children from wealthy families have bigger brains than their poorer counterparts. Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower. Their study found that money was important to a young mind. Parental income was found to be more important than their education. Shown is a picture of Angelina Jolie, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt and Brad Pitt . Brain regions key to academic success were particularly large, the journal Nature Neuroscience reports. Interestingly, the study also revealed that money matters more than parental background when it comes to nourishing the young mind. In one of the first studies of its kind, the US researchers put more than 1,000 healthy children and teenagers through brain scanners and quizzed their parents on their background and income. Richer people live further away from their parents than those on modest wages, a study in December 2014 claimed. The report found workers earning less than £25,000 ($37,000) live within 31 miles (50km) of their family, but this distance grows the wealthier people become. Britons who earn £35,000 to £45,000 ($52,000 to $67,000) live 42 miles (68km) away while those earning more than £55,000 ($81,000) live 47 miles (76km) away. Annuities firm Partnership said this was because high-earning professionals were more likely to have moved away from where they grew up to secure a lucrative career. The study also found people in their 50s live closest to their ageing parents, but later move farther away to be near their own children and grandchildren. While people in their 40s lived 37 miles (60km) away, on average, this reduced to 33 miles (53km) as people reached their early 50s. The youngsters, who were between three and 20 years old, also did tests of memory and something called executive function. This term covers the mental skills that are used to weigh up options, prioritise, multi-task and plan ahead. Children with poor executive function may struggle to memorise information and be more likely to get into fights. Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important. Brain areas key to language and executive function were bigger in children from wealthier families. These youngsters also did better in the mental tests. Researcher Dr Elizabeth Sowell, of the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said: ‘Our data suggest that wider access to resources likely afforded by the more affluent may lead to differences in a child’s brain structure. ‘Access to higher-quality childcare, more cognitively stimulating materials in the home and opportunities for learning outside the home likely account for some of these effects.’ Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important, perhaps because the children had better living conditions (stock image shown) She said that growing up in a household that is free of the stress of struggling to make ends meet is also likely to foster brain development. The link between income and brain structure were particularly noticeable among the most deprived children, with small differences in salary having a relatively big effect on the brain. It is thought this is because a slight increase in income makes a bigger difference to living conditions to someone on a low wage than to someone who is already well provided for. Researcher Dr Kimberley Noble, of Columbia University in New York, said that despite the clear impact of socio-economic status on the young mind, it would be wrong to think that the changes are fixed. She said: ‘This is the critical point. The brain is the product of both genetics and experience and experience is particularly powerful in moulding brain development in childhood. ‘This suggests that interventions to improve socioeconomic circumstance, family life and/or educational opportunity can make a vast difference.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower .\nTheir study found that money was important to a young mind .\nParental income was found to be more important than their education .\nThis is thought to be due to a difference in living conditions ."}]}

Clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer, the BBC reported last week, and \"Top Gear\" -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled Sunday. The BBC's decision to take the show off the air pending an investigation has outraged many of Clarkson's die-hard fans. More than 990,000 of them have signed the petition posted on Change.org by Guido Fawkes, a right-wing political blogger, just a week ago. Whether the show of support will have any impact on the BBC's response is unclear. Clarkson tweeted his thanks Friday night to those who are calling for his reinstatement, saying he is \"very touched.\" The findings of the internal investigation are due to be presented to the corporation's director general next week, the BBC said Thursday. \"Once this has been considered, we will set out any further steps,\" a statement said. The BBC said in an earlier statement that Clarkson, one of the corporation's highest earners, had \"a fracas with a BBC producer.\" In an indication of its popularity, \"Top Gear\" was named as the world's most widely watched factual program in the Guinness World Records 2013 Edition book, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show is sold to 214 territories worldwide. Clarkson vented his apparent frustration in an expletive-filled speech Thursday night in what seemed to be a spontaneous appearance at a charity auction in north London. A CNN reporter who was at the event heard Clarkson swear liberally as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC \"have f***** themselves\" and that it had ruined a great show. Clarkson also auctioned what he said would be one final lap of the \"Top Gear\" track in Surrey, outside London -- used in the show for putting vehicles through their paces -- for £100,000 ($148,000.)  It's not clear whether he had the authority to offer the use of the track for auction -- but his words seem to suggest he doesn't expect his BBC career to continue, even if no decision is expected before next week. \"I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap,\" Clarkson said. \"So I'll go down to Surrey, and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me.\" Whoever placed the winning bid would be able to ride in a car with him on that lap, he said, or in a rare LaFerrari supercar owned by a friend. Clarkson, who's been presenting the show since the late 1980s, added, \"I'll be a bit tearful when I do it.\" The controversial star has at least one influential ally -- UK Prime Minister David Cameron. \"I don't know exactly what happened,\" Cameron told the BBC last week. \"He's a constituent of mine, a friend of mine. He's a huge talent. \"Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who'd be heartbroken if 'Top Gear' was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out, because it's a great program and he's a great talent.\" Opinion: Why we crave the abuse of Jeremy Clarkson . It is not the first time that Clarkson has been at the center of controversy. Last May, the television star asked for forgiveness after using a racist term during a taping of the show. Clarkson had mumbled the N-word while reciting a children's nursery rhyme, but that version of the take was never aired. Last year, the BBC show hit the headlines when Argentina complained about a \"Top Gear\" special filmed in the country in which the number plate H982 FKL was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Forced to stop filming and leave the country, Clarkson said on the BBC Newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental . In a previous article on its website, the BBC said \"Jeremy Clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion.\" Journalist Monica Sarkar contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Top Gear's\" Jeremy Clarkson tweets his thanks to those supporting him .\nA petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for Clarkson's reinstatement delivered to BBC ."}]}

There was the pink coat craze of Autumn 2013, the blanket scarf trend of the winter just passed and who can forget the crop top and high-waisted skirt look worn day-in-day-out by celebrities including Kim Kardashian last summer? This season however, Marks & Spencer style director Belinda Earl believes it's her turn, and she might just be right. Scroll down for video . Marks and Spencer is hoping to raise its fashion game with the new Spring/Summer 2015 clothing collection, namely this limited edition real suede skirt, £199, inspired by the seventies trend fashion revival . Meet the suede skirt M&S is pinning all its hopes on for a much-needed fashion revival. Due in stores next month, the £199 skirt has already been given the celebrity seal of approval. In February, both British model Alexa Chung and New York style icon Olivia Palermo wore the skirt within days of each other, the latter at New York Fashion Week no less. After first debuting their hero design at the Spring/Summer 2015 collection preview for the industry's key fashion editors, there's been a buzz surrounding the Seventies-inspired item. British model and It girl Alexa Chung wore the M&S suede skirt to a celebrity-studded launch party in London. Known for her mix of chic and edgy style, Alexa has sparked more than a few fashion trends in her time . New York socialite and fashion blogger Olivia Palermo, who shot to fame on US reality show The City as an apprentice at fashion house Diane von Furstenberg, debuted the M&S suede skirt at New York Fashion Week . Now M&S is hoping the fashion-led fancies of high street shoppers are taken by the skirt in exactly the same way. The brand has even brought the sale date forward by a month from May to April in anticipation of the frenzy, and seen to it that five times the original order of suede skirts are made. Of her fourth collection for the high street giant, and complete revamp of the brand's failing fashion offering, style director Belinda Earl told British Vogue: 'Everything is coming together. Designed to be both on trend and practical, the soon to be famous Marks and Spencer suede skirt will launch in stores and online 10 April, a month earlier than originally planned to meet high shopper demand . 'The quality, the new styles, the ad campaigns - it's all filtering through. It was never going to be a one-season turnaround.' A cheaper faux suede version of the skirt, priced at £39.50 has already sold out online, raising expectations for the hero number even higher. Inspired by the Seventies trend popular on the Spring/Summer 2015 Fashion Week catwalks, the skirt has also been influenced by M&S archive designs. Seventies icons Ali MacGraw and Jane Birkin are also a key influence on this season's M&S collection, with wearable style and practical glamour running through its core. The seventies fashion trend is set to be a big look for spring and summer, with designers including Gucci (pictured), Mulberry, Alice Temperley and more showing off plenty of brown suede at fashion week SS15 ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can the skirt turn the British brand's falling sales figures around?\nInspired by Seventies fashion icons Jane Birkin and Ali MacGraw .\nExpected to be a limited edition sell-out after hitting stores in April ."}]}

Just Right, which is marketed as ‘low in salt. High in fibre. Goodness of wholegrain’ contains a shocking seven teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams. It’s ‘healthy’ counterparts in the cereal aisle such as Nutri Grain contain eight teaspoons of sugar, while Sultana Bran and Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal both boast five and a half. Scroll down for video . Kellogg's Sultana Bran contains five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams and Just Right has a shocking seven teaspoons . Dieter's staple Special K, which is sold as '99% fat free', has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. In fact, the average sugar content of all 20 cereals analysed by the Obesity Policy Coalition was 19.8g per 100g – that’s almost 20 per cent sugar, about five teaspoons of the dangerous ingredient. Children’s cereals are, less surprisingly, also packed full of sugar. Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium. While Fruit Loops boasts nine and a half teaspoons of sugar, despite being labelled promisingly as ‘no artificial flavours, no artificial colours’. In the children's aisle, Nutri Grain contains eight teaspoons of sugar and colourful Fruit Loops has nine and a half . Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams – highlighting that they should probably only be eaten as a treat. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks, but also those found naturally in honey, syrups and fruit juices. That equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink. However, the UN agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits. Yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this just in our first meal of the day – cereal. Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal, which advertises itself as 'No artificial flavours, colours or preservatives', has five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams. Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams . The Obesity Policy Coalition (OPC) says its findings suggest Australian cereal manufacturers are potentially misleading consumers by promoting healthy sounding statements on their packaging despite sugar making up more than 35 per cent of the ingredients of some popular brands. Executive Manager of the OPC Jane Martin said: ‘Many breakfast cereals contain high levels of sugar, but manufacturers use all sorts of creative phrases on their labels to give consumers the impression they’re a nutritious choice for breakfast. It’s as though they are prepared to tell consumers only half the story. ‘Many parents would be horrified to learn that for every three mouthfuls of Nutri-Grain, one is just sugar, while a small bowl contains twice as much sodium as a small packet of chips.’ Special K only has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium . Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered 'high' in sugar . Cheerios are '69% wholegrain. No artificial colours or flavours' but contain five teaspoons of sugar. All Bran has three teaspoons of sugar . ‘The Health Star Rating System was introduced more than a year ago to help consumers compare the overall nutritional quality of products at a glance. The system helps consumers better understand a product’s overall health rating so they can make informed choices, but our research has revealed very few cereals, as yet, carry the star label,’ Ms Martin said. ‘Clearer labelling through such a system is a vital step in helping consumers make healthier choices in an environment where approximately 63 per cent of Australian adults and 25 per cent of Australian children are overweight or obese.’ Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered ‘high’ in sugar and or salt, a product with over 400mg of sodium per 100 grams is considered ‘high’ in salt."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Average sugar content of 20 cereals analysed was about five teaspoons .\nSome brands such as Nutri Grain included eight teaspoons per 100 grams .\nProducts marketed as 'low in salt' where often packed with sugar instead .\nJust Right and Sultana Bran are both 'high' in sugar .\nChildren's cereals like Coco Pops are even worse with nine teaspoons .\nObesity Policy Coalition (OPC) says its findings suggest Australian cereal manufacturers are potentially misleading consumers ."}]}

Walsall are set to play Bristol City in the final of this year's tournament on March 22, but in future second-string sides from the Premier League would be allowed to compete with the 48 League One and Two teams if plans are finalised. Football League clubs authorised the Football League's executive to push forward with the plans last month, although a formal proposal is yet to be passed. The Johnstone's Paint Trophy could involve Premier League 'B' teams in future if plans get the go-ahead . Youth squads from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea could soon be headed for the lower-tier cup . If the Football League do bring 'B' teams into the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by Greg Dyke last year, meaning teams would: . And in a meeting of AFC Wimbledon's Supporters' Trust, The Dons Trust, it was revealed that only one League Two club voted against the idea - Wimbledon themselves. FA Chairman Greg Dyke proposed the idea of bringing 'B' teams into the league pyramid itself in June last year but was told that Football League clubs had 'no appetite' for such a move. However it now seems that they are more keen on introducing the development squads into the JPT in a move that could one day see youth sides from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea facing each other in a Wembley Stadium show-piece final. A statement from the Football League clarifying the situation read: 'Clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 U21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in The Football League Trophy. 'The competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one U21 team in each group, before a knockout stage leading to a final at Wembley Stadium. 'Given the previous concerns of the League and its clubs about Premier League B teams playing in the pyramid, any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the League's Articles of Association that would protect the current 72 club constitution, save for any changes to promotion/relegation that clubs wished to make. Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future . 'Therefore, having provided them with this comfort, clubs willingly debated the potential commercial, financial and player development benefits of having U21 teams in this competition from 2015/16. 'No formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken. 'Instead, League One and Two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see The Football League progress the matter, which would include discussions with the Premier League and Football Association, so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point.'

Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell feline holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat and reached another milestone Friday when she turned 27 years old. The cat, who was born on March 13, 1988 in San Diego, California has now lived the equivalent of 125 human years. Old age: Tiffany Two, a tortoiseshell feline, pictured, holds the Guinness World Record for the oldest living cat . Owner: Sharon Voorhees, pictured, paid just $10 for Tiffany Two when the cat was just six weeks old and has been caring for her ever since . Tiffany Two's owner Sharon Voorhees said she paid just $10 for the cat when she bought her from a pet store at six weeks old. She boasts that it was the 'best money she ever spent.' According to the Guinness World Records the short-haired black and orange tortoiseshell is officially the world's oldest living cat. Voorhees recalls that at the time she bought Tiffany Two she also purchased two dogs, born around the same time, but they died years ago. Meanwhile, she explains that the cat's unusual name was  a tribute to another tortoiseshell cat she owned in the 1970s. And while the 27-year-old is generally in good health, she does suffer from high blood pressure. Tweet: Guinness World Records tweeted 'this week oldest cat Tiffany Two turned 27 years old' But Vorhees says she still enjoys roaming around outside and is 'not feeble and still able to go up and down stairs'. Years ago, Tiffany Two had a stint on the open road after she went missing for two years. It's not known where she went. Today, she enjoys  staying inside but does venture outdoors sometimes. Voorhees said: 'She's not afraid of anything or anyone. She walks right past the dogs, she's very feisty!' As Tiffany Two  grows old gracefully she still has good sight and hearing and eats both 'wet food and dry food.' However, the record-breaker is not the oldest cat ever recorded throughout history. That achievement belongs to a feline from Austin, Texas, called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and died on until 6 August 2005 at the ripe old age of 38.

Sevilla remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow Spanish side Villarreal. Having done most of the damage with a 3-1 first leg win at El Madrigal, Sevilla finished things off at home with a 2-1 victory courtesy of second-half goals from Vicente Iborra and his replacement Denis Suarez. Villarreal had netted in-between those strikes through Giovani dos Santos' fine free-kick but almost immediately had centre-back Eric Bailly sent off as they tumbled out 5-2 on aggregate. On-loan Barcelona player Denis Suarez (centre) heads home the winning goal against ten-man Villarreal . Napoli are also through after a hard-fought goalless draw against Dinamo Moscow in Russia. The Italians held a 3-1 lead from the first leg and that proved sufficient as they survived a second-leg onslaught from Stanislav Cherchesov's men. Zenit St Petersburg qualified for the quarters despite going down 1-0 to a late headed goal from Torino's Kamil Gilk at the Stadio Olimpico. Zenit arrived for the second leg in Italy with a two-goal cushion, and it proved just enough for Andre Villas-Boas' team to progress after a bruising encounter.

This was not the most beautiful goal, it was a heavily deflected free kick, but it is special for me because it was Orlando City’s first ever goal. When I signed for the newly-formed MLS side I really wanted to score their first goal. We were losing by a goal, in their MLS debut game, and the match was in stoppage time, but I hit a 25-yard free kick to the goalkeepers’s right a it took a huge deflection and went into the left of goal.

The game was poised at 1-1 and there were only four minutes remaining of the match. I received the ball from Massimo Ambrosini 10 yards inside their half on the left as we broke from our own penalty area. I just kept running with the ball past one player, then another, then one more on the edge of the Fenerbahce box before finishing low under Volkan Demirel.

It was late in the game and the ball came out from an Argentina corner. I managed to steal the ball from Lionel Messi and started running at full speed with the ball. He chased me all the way, but I kept ahead of him, ran past Gabriel Milito then finished low past Roberto Abbondanzieri. Pablo Zabaleta couldn’t stop it going over the line, however hard he tried.

RSPCA Inspector Patrick Bailey said: 'I have come across some pretty poorly dogs in my time as an inspector but I can safely say there have been few that have been as thin as this poor lurcher. 'She was completely emaciated, and looked to be just skin stretched over bone. 'She had fur loss from her shoulders down, was absolutely covered in fleas and her claws were long and overgrown. 'From her body condition I really don't think she had many days left had she not been found. 'We dread to think what would've happened to these dogs had they not been found.' The lurcher was found with a Jack Russell (pictured) in New Forest, Hampshire, and the pair have formed a close bond . Recovering: It may be some weeks before the poorly lurcher is in a fit enough state to be re-homed . An RSPCA inspector said he had never seen a dog as thin and emaciated as the lurcher, which was found earlier this week . The dogs, who are both female, are now recovering however it could be some time before the lurcher is in a fit enough state to find a new family. Because of their bond, the canine companions could be re-homed together, but this may not be the possible because the Jack Russell is likely to be healthy enough to be re-homed sooner. Mr Bailey added: 'We don't know how long these dogs have been straying and we don't know how they got there or where they came from. 'It seems unusual that the two dogs were so polar opposite in their health and wellbeing and as such I am keen to hear from anyone who can offer information regarding them, especially the lurcher. 'It is possible that these dogs have been straying independently before joining up to form this mismatched pair and it could be that the lurcher has been fending for herself for quite some time to arrive in this poor condition. 'However she is extremely affectionate, enjoys fuss and attention and seems very keen to be around people. 'She has clearly been socialised but I cannot rule out the possibility that she has been neglected before straying or possibly even being dumped.' The RSPCA is appealing for the owner or owners of the duo to come forward so they can be reunited, or for anyone with details about where they may have come from to contact them. Anyone with information can call the RSPCA Inspector Appeal Line on 0300 123 8018."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lurcher found roaming the streets just days from death rescued by RSPCA .\nSkeletal dog's rib cage and spine can be seen and she was missing fur .\nCanine met a Jack Russell on the streets and pair were wandering together .\nRSPCA inspector says lurcher is one of the worst neglect cases ever seen .\nBoth of the dogs are now recovering and they could be re-homed together ."}]}

It was a surgery of the kind that Angelina Jolie recently underwent, as she revealed Tuesday in a New York Times op-ed.  Two years ago, Jolie divulged that she'd had a prophylactic double mastectomy -- I had done this as well, in 2012. Along with the effects of the surgeries themselves, we now also share a related fallout: surgical menopause. This change can be big and, for me, happened almost immediately. There is little easing into it: the age-inappropriate night sweats, hot flashes, weight gain, mood swings.  When I had my ovaries removed at age 37, I suddenly felt less vibrant and beautiful, and instead experienced the slow creep of feeling old.  What will this transition mean to someone like Jolie, so identified for her attractiveness and glamour? (She may keep that part of her transformation private, but -- as with her disclosures about the surgeries -- it might do some good to discuss that, as well.) I've been talking and writing about BRCA1 since I learned more than 10 years ago that I carried this insidious, inherited genetic mutation.  I've discussed how these operations have affected my relationship with my husband and our two children.  But often it takes someone as public, as gorgeous, as famous as Ms. Jolie to powerfully move the conversation about cancer prevention surgeries forward. Her transparency helps normalize the experience of women considering their own options.  It chips away at the stigma surrounding this treatment decision and offers women a new shorthand for explaining such a difficult choice to their families. When I underwent each of my surgeries a few friends looked at me sideways.  They weren't familiar with BRCA and or how surgery could statistically reduce my chances of developing cancer.  Now Ms. Jolie has changed this. Her willingness to share such intimate experiences means more people will become educated and more BRCA survivors will feel free to speak of their scars.  And there are many resources for BRCA-positive women. In June, I will be speaking at the annual FORCE conference (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered), which has partnered with another wonderful organization, the Basser Research Center for BRCA  (part of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania). Both are leading the way in the scientific research and understanding of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.  They also provide resources around risk assessment, prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship, as well as links to chat rooms and local support groups. It's not often a writer finds her circumstances so closely in sync with a Hollywood star.  But I like to think Ms. Jolie and I, two women who truly have nothing in common, are linked in our determination to be proactive.  We have looked fear in the face and made the only decisions that made sense for our families and our selves."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Like Angelina Jolie, Allison Gilbert had two preventive cancer surgeries to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes and  later her breasts .\nGilbert:Jolie's disclosure about her surgeries has brought needed attention to this surgical option for carriers of insidious BRCA1 gene ."}]}

There was Rita Moreno and Gloria Estefan and ... well, that's about it. The March 31, 1995, death of the Mexican-American singer plunged many Latino listeners into mourning and brought her music to the attention of English speakers who would soon become fans. Selena Quintanilla-Perez started singing the Tejano music that eventually made her famous in her father's restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father Abraham taught the family band and named them Los Dinos after his own group from earlier years. Selena's brother, A.B., played bass, and her sister, Suzette, played drums. When the family moved to Corpus Christi, the group started getting gigs at local parties and weddings. Selena was only 15 when she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards. That got her a record contract, and several albums followed. She eventually married her guitarist, Chris Perez. In 1994, she won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album for \"Selena Live!\" and seemed poised for mainstream stardom. When the president of Selena's fan club shot her to death the following year in a Texas motel room, her first English-language album was months from release. Her death made international headlines. She was 23 years old. Twenty years later, her influence is still being felt. Her official Facebook page still has more than 2 million likes, and fans are remembering the singer who crossed barriers and made them sing and dance to her blend of Tejano music. Fans will celebrate her life and legacy at the commemorative Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi in mid-April. Here are five things you may not know about Selena. Selena had to learn Spanish. A third-generation Texan of Mexican descent, Selena didn't grow up speaking Spanish. Neither did her husband, Perez, who played guitar in her band and fell in love with her on the road. In his book, \"To Selena, with Love,\" Perez said they practiced speaking Spanish before their first big publicity blitz in Mexico. \"In Mexico, Selena mangled her conversations in Spanish like the rest of us, but not for long.\" \"She said, 'It'll be cool. You watch. I'm going to learn Spanish and surprise everybody,' \" Perez wrote. \"She got better and better, to the point where I'd have to ask her to slow down so that I could understand what she was saying.\" She sold out the Astrodome. Selena performed several times at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at the Astrodome to sold-out crowds of more than 60,000 people. (It wasn't just any rodeo: Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and the Osmonds have all played the event.) \"We had 20 performances this year,\" Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show, told the New York Times in 1995. \"We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome.\" Her album went to No. 1. Her 1995 crossover album, \"Dreaming of You,\" went to the top of the Billboard 200 the first week it was released. She was the first Latin artist to debut atop the list. \"There were supposed to be 14 tracks, but we had only recorded four of them, so we put together a tribute album of new and old songs,\" Nancy Brennan, then vice president of A&R at EMI, told Texas Monthly. \"Making that album was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do, because we were listening to her voice all day and crying as we were mixing the songs.\" \"Selena\" (the movie) ignited Jennifer Lopez's career. Starring as Selena in the 1997 movie of the same name, Jennifer Lopez became the first Latina actress to be paid $1 million for a movie role. Lopez was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. \"Getting to play the part of Selena was life-changing for me,\" Lopez told Para Todos magazine. \"I got to immerse myself in her life, got to know her family, her home, her culture ... every part of her story. It was a special time in my life both professionally and personally. Playing her not only opened doors for me in the film world, but it inspired me to start my own music career. In a lot of ways, I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had that experience.\" Selena's killer is eligible for parole in 2025. Yolanda Saldivar, the president of Selena's fan club, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1995 for Selena's murder. Saldivar must serve at least 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole. Selena was meeting with Saldivar at a Corpus Christi motel to discuss her concerns that Saldivar had embezzled money from her when Saldivar shot her, according to trial testimony. Saldivar argued that she accidentally fired the shot, but the jury didn't buy it.

But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a \"black ooze,\" it said. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy . The role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by Harvard professor Ralph Mitchell and researcher Alice DeAraujo, according to the news release. Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans . But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. \"You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem,\" he is quoted as saying. A \"complicated process\" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release. It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

Pietersen has become optimistic his England career could yet be revived and reports on Tuesday claimed that the 34-year-old had held conversations with intermediaries acting for the ECB. 'He hasn't asked me for a meeting,' said Downton. 'As far as the ECB is concerned no position has changed. We put out a statement last week.' Reports suggested that England outcast Kevin Pietersen had contacted the ECB over a return . Pietersen has not ruled out an England return after comments made by incoming chairman Colin Graves . Downton was one of the key figures in casting Pietersen out of the England set-up following last year's 5-0 Ashes whitewash and when asked if he would consider a meeting with the South Africa-born batman, he added: 'I don't know what to say to that to be honest. 'It's not something that is at the forefront of the selectors' minds now. We've got a group of players that we are working with and looking to progress the England team. 'Nothing has changed from where we were in the last year.' Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves kick-started Pietersen's hopes of a return a fortnight ago when he suggested he should play county cricket if he was serious about playing for England again. The ECB released a statement later that day to clarify Graves' comments which said 'nothing had changed' regarding Pietersen's England future. England were embarrassingly knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages after defeat by Bangladesh . The South African-born batsman was axed by England following the 2014 Ashes whitewash . Paul Downtown insists 'nothing has changed' Pietersen has nonetheless been impressed by Graves and on Tuesday morning backed the 67-year-old entrepreneur to make the changes to revitalise England in the wake of their early World Cup exit. Pietersen alluded to a recent relaxation in ECB policy to allow players to be available for the entire Indian Premier League as a positive step and that he suspected it was the start of a progressive period under Graves. Pietersen posted on Twitter: 'Quick note - ECB doesn't decide who gets to play in IPL/Big Bash. The franchises have to want them! Plenty have tried & failed to get a go! 'But, the encouraging news is that the new boss has the vision to look to open up a window to hopefully give players a better chance! 'I really do think changes are going to be made & positive things are going to start to happen for the good of English cricket...' England's World Cup embarrassment has given ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe Pietersen and while Graves' comments have forced the ECB to reinforce their stance on a player who left Surrey last autumn, Downton said it has not caused him any discomfort. 'What Colin said was absolutely right,' he said. 'To be picked for England you have to be scoring an awful amount of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors as a positive influence on the side.

The Australian Red Cross said via Twitter that \"humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water (are) urgent priorities\" in Port Vila. Meteorologists said the storm has weakened some, but it was still pounding the islands after hours of fierce winds and torrential rain. \"#CyclonePam still tearing through #Vanuatu. 'Much bigger than expected,' says our colleague in Port Vila. Initial reports of devastation,\" the Australian branch of UNICEF said on Twitter earlier. Pam, one of the strongest storms seen in the South Pacific in years, earlier made a direct hit on the capital, raising fears of mass destruction. In its 8 a.m. Saturday update, the Vanuatu Meteorological Services warned of \"very destructive hurricane force winds\" of 155 mph (250 kilometers per hour) in Shefa and Tafea provinces, with several others facing \"very rough to phenomenal seas with heavy swells.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane to a Category 4. It has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a 36-hour period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph (305 kph). Track the storm . Pam is forecast to move southeastward along the western edge of the southern islands of Vanuatu. It isn't expected to make any additional landfalls before dissipating. It will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear. Pam is expected to pass east of New Zealand on Sunday and into Monday. It could bring heavy rainfall to North Island, including Auckland. The capital, the biggest city in the Vanuatu island chain, sits on the coastline, which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013. Chloe Morrison, an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm. \"Seven hours hunkered down and it's still not safe to go outside,\" she said. \"The winds are still really howling. We're really lucky to be in a concrete house.\" Part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows, she said. She also noted that two trees outside didn't get uprooted, but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining. Despite the \"quite terrifying ordeal,\" Morrison said, their house didn't have any damage. Through the night, the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors, she said. World Vision, which says it's been based in Vanuatu for more than 30 years, said its emergency assessment  team would head out to view the damage when it is safe. The staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water, food, blankets, tarpaulins, and shelter, hygiene and kitchen kits in key places, it said, as well as advising on disaster preparedness. Residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches, universities and schools. \"The strongest thing they've got is cement churches,\" said Inga Mepham, program director for CARE International for the Vanuatu program. \"Some of them don't have that. It's hard to find a structure that you'd think would be able to withstand a Category 5 (storm).\" Earlier, photographer Michael McLennan -- who said the storm is being called the \"Vanuatu Monster\" -- told CNN that the \"strength of winds is incredible.\" Video footage he shot earlier Friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain. Evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country. Even before the sun rose Saturday, Vanuatu was already getting hit hard, with most communication and power cut off due to the storm. \"The wind outside is terrifying,\" Michael Wolfe, World Vision's national director in Vanuatu, told that organization. \"I can't imagine what it's like for families out there who weren't able to find safe shelter before the storm.\" The archipelago nation northeast of Australia contains 83 small islands, many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a walloping storm. Because of the tropical climate in Vanuatu, some of the housing is made of lighter building materials, including straw and corrugated metals. Residents prepared for the storm, boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury. CNN host Bill Weir, who was recently in Vanuatu on assignment, said that while Port Vila has some modern development in the form of an airport, large hotels and a convention center that's under construction, life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years. \"For search and rescue, for bringing food and supplies and medicine, it's extremely challenging,\" he said. Pam has triggered watches and warnings in the Solomon Islands and New Zealand.

A Chinese restaurant in Nairobi,  which barred black customers after 5pm, has been shut down with its owners summoned before authorities . The restaurant's rule was brought into place after a robbery in 2013 and was not meant to cause offence, the owners said. 'We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't,' restaurant relations manager Esther Zhao told the Daily Nation. But Otiende Amollo, the Ombudsman, said it was both illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate against an individual on the grounds of their race, gender or ethnicity. He said: 'That amounts to racial and ethnic profiling, which is unconstitutional. 'It has in it the inherent assumption that Africans are inevitably pre-disposed to be robbers.' Residents took to social media to express their anger at being banned from the Chinese using the hashtags #RacistRestaurant, #NoBlacksHere and #TheChineseInvasion.

One Kenyan MP even asked the Parliamentary Committee on Security to carry out its own investigation. Nairobi governor Evans Kidero said the restaurant was shut because it did not have the proper licences. He said: 'We have established that the restaurant did not have the licences and I have ordered it closed until the management complies. 'The owners of the restaurant have no change of user from residential to commercial which is a requirement to operate a business in Nairobi. 'As of now the restaurant will remain closed until they comply with all set rules and regulations. We have deployed security officers around the premises.' But he added: 'All business and service providers must ensure that all customers and clients are treated with respect and dignity, irrespective of race, colour, sex, tribe and religion.' China's relationship with Kenya and much of Africa has been seen as being at an all-time high - notably with huge investments in major infrastructure projects.

Embrace: The 71-year-old was hugged by a companion two days after the iconic actor, who played Mr Spock, died in their home in Bel Air . Relationship: The couple were married for 26 years. The actress and Mr Nimoy's son Adam announced his death on Friday . However the Canadian actor, who played Captain Kirk, was the target of a barrage of abuse over the weekend by Twitter users condemning his decision not to attend and stay at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. According to reports the service was restricted to a small number of guests, including the couple's children Adam and Julie, and the star's stepson Aaron Bay Schuck. Afterwards, his family wrote a statement on Facebook saying: 'Thank you for all the love and kind words to Leonard. We lost a wonderful, talented, sweet man, a great father, husband, grandpa, and friend. 'Again thank you for all the love and good wishes. R.I.P and LLAP.' It is Jewish tradition for the dead to be buried within 24 hours of their passing. But, as the practice is forbidden on a Saturday, Nimoy was buried on Sunday. Although fans were barred from attending, they found their own ways to pay their respects. A moment of silence was held at the the Long Beach Comic Expo, a two-day comic book convention in California, with many attendees also dressed as Spock. Meanwhile, the actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was adorned with flowers, photographs and tribute messages. Mr Shanter revealed on Saturday that he would not be able to make it back for the service. The 83-year-old was seen landing at LAX at 11:30am, two hours after family and friends gathered to pay their respects. Speaking to TMZ outside the terminal building, he said the charity event went 'very well' but would not comment on the funeral. He led the tributes to the late actor following his death on Friday, saying he loved him like a 'brother'. Despite defending his claims and insisting his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth would be there, he received a wave of shocking abuse online. Statement: His family thanked supporters for their love on Facebook after the funeral and urged followers to 'Live Long and Prosper' Shatner was spotted on Sunday wearing the same clothes he had been wearing on Friday, as he touched down in Florida just hours after the actor who he described as a 'brother' passed away . Tributes: Shatner tweeted tributes to Nimoy (together, left, in 2009) as he attended an event with his wife (right) Elizabeth for the 58th International Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach . 'Lame excuse': A Twitter user condemned the decision by Mr Shatner. Others questioned why he didn't pay for a flight back from the event . When he revealed he was in Florida attending the Red Cross Ball and couldn't make it back in time, one of his followers said: 'Lame excuse. Man up.' Social media users demanded to know why Shatner did not pay $30,000 to fly back from Palm Beach to LA immediately after the Red Cross event on Saturday night. 'Priceline? Do Red Cross event and then private jet to LA,' wrote Todd Schnitt, a host of a morning talk show on WOR AM 710. Another said: 'Why not fly back right after?' Shatner responded to the trolls with memories of Nimoy. Family and close friends of the iconic actor who played Mr Spock gathered at 9am on Sunday to pay their respects after he passed away at his Bel Air, Los Angeles, home on Friday. Shatner was pictured catching an early flight on Sunday with his wife Elizabeth from Palm Beach to Los Angeles. He landed at LAX at 11.30am and so would have been in air during the service. Defence: Shatner responded to comments condemning his decision, saying he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago, adding that his daughters Melanie and Lisabeth will be there . Bond: The pair (pictured during a scene of the 1982 film Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan) became friends during filming and remained close until Nimoy's tragic passing . Shatner was pictured early on Sunday morning at the airport in Palm Beach. He was wearing the same clothes as when he had jetted in on Friday. The actor had earlier responded to comments condemning his no show decision at his old friend's funeral, explaining that he was honoring a commitment he had made months ago. Answering one post addressed at him, he said: 'Walking out on a major fundraiser wouldn't have you calling me a jerk for leaving a charity high & dry? Hmm?' In response to people who expressed anger toward him for not flying to Los Angeles, the actor wrote: 'One of the other misconceptions seems to be that folks think flights to LAX occur all night long.' He then used the social media platform to share his memories of Nimoy and answer questions from his followers about the late actor using the hashtag '#leonardnimoy.' 'I do want to thank everyone for coming here and sharing their memories and celebrating the life of LLAP! MBB,' he tweeted. After the charity event at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Shatner spoke to Local 10, but did not mention the funeral. He said: 'He [Nimoy] had a good, long life. He did a lot of things. He inspired a lot of people. He was loved by a lot of people and he loved a lot of people. 'It's sad that you have to be reminded that life is that short.' Shatner, posted a distraught message on Twitter on Sunday, the morning after he touched down at a Florida airport following his best friend's death. In the post, the 83-year-old Canadian actor wrote: 'I am currently in FL [Florida] as I agreed to appear at the Red Cross Ball tonight. Leonard's funeral is tomorrow. I can't make it back in time. 'I feel really awful. Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.'

The quake struck at a depth of 65 kilometers (40 miles), about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the town of Kokopo, near Rabaul, at around 10am local time, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It was followed by a 5.7-magnitude aftershock and a 1.5-foot-high tsunami, which was measured in Rabaul's harbor, near the quake's epicenter, said Martin Mose, from the National Disaster Center. But despite the quake - which was likely  felt by people up to a staggering 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away - and the subsequent tsunami, no damage nor injuries have been reported, officials said. Quake: This photo, released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shows a shakemap of the region (white cross) in Papua New Guinea where a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Monday . The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had warned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 10 feet in parts of Papua New Guinea, and waves of less than one foot in other Pacific countries. It said 'hazardous tsunami waves were possible for coasts located within 1,000 km of the earthquake epicentre along the coasts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands'. But the center lifted the warning a few hours later, after reporting a one-inch tsunami wave was measured at a wharf in the Solomon Islands, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the epicenter. A Geoscience Australia spokesman told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that while a tsunami warning had been issued for Papua New Guinea, there was no threat to Australia at the time. Target: The quake struck at a depth of 65 kilometers (40 miles), about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the town of Kokopo, near Rabaul (pictured), at around 10am local time, the U.S. Geological Survey reported .

Above, another shakemap of the region . 'We've had no reports of a tsunami being generated for local region at this stage,' he said. In Rabaul, residents noticed the sea level rose slightly, prompting ocean water to flood the parking lot of a shopping center near the beach, said Mika Tuvi, an employee at the Rabaul Hotel. 'But nothing beyond that - no damage caused,' she said. When the quake struck, guests and workers at the hotel fled outside, fearing the building would collapse, Ms Tuvi said. The tremors, which lasted for about 5 minutes, were frightening in their intensity, but the hotel withstood the shaking, she said. Location: The quake hit about 10am local time Monday and a tsunami warning has been issued in the region . No threat: On Monday, Geoscience Australia said there was no immediate threat to Australia . Officials in the capital, Port Moresby, were working to contact their counterparts in the outer provinces, but hours after the quake, there still had been no reports of damage or injuries. Mr Mose said he was confident the nation had averted a major catastrophe. The quake caused strong shaking and knocked items off shelves in Kokopo, and was felt 500 miles away in Port Moresby, said Chris McKee, assistant director of the Geophysical Observatory.

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's ruling on Friday gives the government, which has fought the case for over a decade, two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released. The American Civil Liberties Union has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006. This image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. A federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the US military . 'To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,' said Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director. 'Giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context.' The Defense Department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court, spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins III said. Early in the 2004 lawsuit, the ACLU pointed to the Abu Ghraib photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees. It's unclear how many more photographs may exist. The government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more, Hellerstein said in a ruling in August. He said some photos he had seen 'are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration,' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them. Some photographs, taken by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse. Some images show 'soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees,' then-Solicitor General — now Supreme Court Justice — Elena Kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case, which has taken a long road through the courts and Congress. The fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it invokes the images of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (inside pictured) that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 . The government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against U.S. forces and government personnel abroad, and officials have said that risk hasn't abated as the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan lessened. Indeed, 'the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now,' amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris, the vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a December court filing. Islamic State, he said 'would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack U.S. military and government personnel.' Amid the lawsuit, Congress passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger U.S. citizens or government or military personnel. Defense secretaries have since done so, but Hellerstein said the government hasn't been specific enough."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Follows a long-running clash concerning how prisoners were treated .\nThe government has fought the case for more than a decade .\nImages from Abu Grhaib prison in Baghdad sparked outrage in 2004 .\nThey now have two months to decide whether to appeal the ruling ."}]}

Brett Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly harassing and discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation. Bingham found out he was being placed on leave during a field trip with his students on Friday. Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year Brett Bingham claims he has been placed on paid adminsitrative leave because he used his title as a platform to speak publicly about being gay . He said it was his lawyer, who received a letter from the district, who broke the news. 'I returned to school and nobody spoke to me,' he told Fox 12. 'At 3.30 I just packed up my favorite plants and put a box of my stuff together that I was afraid would be thrown away and I left.' According to a complaint Bingham filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries Civil Rights Division, problems with the district began shortly after he was named the state's  teacher of the year in October 2013. Bingham claims one such incident occurred after he was asked about his sexual orientation while giving a speech. The teacher said his department head left the event immediately and without saying anything to Bingham. He then claims she told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head'. Bingham then alleged that the district placed him under a 'gag order' in April and told him he could not publicly speak or write unless his comments were approved. The teacher said he then filed a grievance with his union, which stated that he felt he was receiving 'disparate treatment' because of his sexual orientation. Bingham (pictured here with his partner on their wedding day) claims one department head told him he could not speak about being gay or 'someone is going to shoot you in the head' Bingham claims the following retaliation was swift. He said he was told that he now had to receive district approval before he could attend any teacher of the year events and was denied from appearing at two Gay Straight Student Alliance events, as well as working with a local LGBTQ community center. Bingham said management also began ordering him to pick up coffee and take out their garbage, 'menial tasks' he claims he was not asked to perform 'prior to the greater public awareness of my sexual orientation'. Relations between Bingham and the district worsened when school officials said the teacher would lose his job if he attended a gala for the National Education Association's Foundation, who were presenting him with an award, in Washington, D.C., he claims. District Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen allegedly told Bingham he would not be granted leave to attend any events related to teacher of the year, claiming he had too many school absences. Bingham, who teaches special education, has filed multiple complaints against the Multnomah Education Service District for allegedly discriminating against the educator because of his sexual orientation . Relations between Bingham and the district worsened after the teacher was told he would lose his job if he attended the National Education Association gala, where he was to be presented with an award . In a tweet Bingham claimed district officials told him they would consider letting him 'attend the NEA awards' if he recalled his state and federal complaints. Bingham was eventually allowed to attend the event after the Oregon Education Association found a clause in his contract that protected his job, according to OregonLive. Jorgensen was removed from the Superintendent position last week but the district claimed Bingham's complaints were not a factor, according to Fox 12. But Bingham believes nothing has changed and that there are other officials in the district who want to see him fired. 'There's no other explanation because I've never been in trouble,' he said. 'I have an excellent reputation.'

Having edged out their round-four tie at the Millennium Stadium, Gatland’s side are still in the hunt for the championship but they must better the points difference of both England and Ireland to top the standings. Wales have won their last seven meetings against the Azzuri, however they will have to prepare for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico with major fitness concerns over Jamie Roberts, Richard Hibbard, Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee. Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned his team to focus on winning against Italy before running up a score . A delighted Wales team celebrates keeping their 2015 RBS Six Nations title hopes alive with victory . ‘If you go in with an attitude that we need to score, 20, 30 or 40 points then we’ll get caught with our pants down and be rolled over,’ said Gatland. ‘It will be tough for Italy with a six-day turnaround. Italy are not a bad side. It’s important to do a job up front and accumulate points. ‘It could come down to the last 15 or 20 minutes. It will be nice to go there and get a win and hopefully win by a few. We’re first up at the weekend so we’ll see how the other teams react afterwards. It puts us under some pressure but hopefully it puts England and Ireland under some pressure too.’ England face a potential banana-skin tie against France, while Ireland have a trip to wooden spoon favourites Scotland. Like Gatland, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will also approach the closing weekend with caution. The Kiwi coach found himself in a similar situation 12 months ago, when he pipped the English to the title with a dramatic victory at the Stade de France. Sam Warburton gives a thumb up after an heroic defensive effort from Wales in their win over Ireland . Warburton makes a run at Ireland hooker Rory Best at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . ‘I suppose it’s a bit similar to last year, when we just knew we needed the result in Paris,’ said Schmidt. ‘That’s something we managed to do and we won the championship on the back of it, and England had to sit and watch. But you’ve got to beat those teams first. I don’t think you can afford to go anywhere and start chasing points . . . Scotland are going to be very difficult to beat.’ Last night’s defeat in Cardiff was not how Paul O’Connell hoped to celebrate his 100th Test. The 35-year-old was outfoxed at the line-out by Alun-Wyn Jones and Luke Charteris, admitting that he is itching to right those wrongs at Murrayfield next week. ‘The guys are very disappointed but it’s not up to Joe or me or anyone to lift anyone, it’s up to individuals to lift themselves,’ said O’Connell. ‘One thing about losing is that you just want to get out there and play again as soon as you can.’ Gatland praised his medical team for introducing a ‘spotter’ who flagged up Hibbard’s head injury. Richard Hibbard was withdrawn after his head injury was spotted by video analysis and doctors alerted . Following the controversy of George North’s concussion against England, chief medical manager Prav Mathema moved to increase his resources to deal with the issue. Hibbard’s 78th-minute injury was picked up on video analysis equipment, with the spotter subsequently ordering the team doctors via radio to remove the hooker from the pitch. ‘Prav has put in place a spotter with video access,’ said Gatland. ‘It’s pleasing because there’s been so much said about concussion.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wales beat Ireland to keep Six Nations challenge alive .\nWarren Gatland's side probably need to beat Italy convincingly to win title .\nBut Welsh coach insists his team must focus on just getting the result .\nEngland, Ireland and Wales all have six points after four games ."}]}

The virus devastated a flock of 15,000 turkeys in western Minnesota's Pope County. It's the same highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian influenza that's been confirmed in backyard and wild birds in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. However, it's the first appearance of the strain in the Mississippi flyway [states around the Mississippi river] said Dr. Bill Hartmann, Minnesota's state veterinarian. Fewer than 100 of the turkeys were still alive by Thursday, Hartmann said. The flock has been quarantined and the remaining birds were being killed. A flock of 15,000 turkeys was wiped out on a farm in Minnesota in a week by a deadly strain of bird flu carried by wild waterfowl that are not sickened by it. The strain has already been found in the Pacific Northwest . Dr. Bill Hartmann (left) said that this is the first appearance of the strain in the area. Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson (right) said: 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best' No other commercial flocks are nearby, he said, but 'backyard flocks' within a 10-kilometer area (approximately six miles) were being tested for the disease. The virus is carried by wild waterfowl that aren't sickened by it. The incubation period is approximately 21 days. 'We're encouraged that we'll be able to prevent the spread of the disease,' Hartmann said. 'We should be able to contain this without much difficulty.' 'If we can get through the next 21 days without finding anything, we should be in good shape,' Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson added. Minnesota is the nation's top turkey producer, with industry groups claiming to produce some 46 million turkeys each year worth around $750 million. Frederickson said about 8 per cent of that production, or $92 million worth, was exported in 2013. He acknowledged that those exports could take a hit, as poultry exports from states in the Northwest already have. 'We're very cognizant of that,' Frederickson said. 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best.' The risk to humans is low, state and federal officials announced on Thursday. Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger stressed there is no danger to the general public . Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger said the only humans at risk were four people who worked directly with the infected flock and they will be monitored.

Hartmann said he was prohibited by law from identifying the farm or saying where it's located in Pope County. Nearly all commercial turkey operations keep their birds inside large barns and they never go outside. Hartmann said that was the true for the affected farm, too. He said turkeys in only one of the farm's four barns got sick. Farm workers found 70 dead turkeys on February 26 and notified the state the next day when hundreds died. The state got confirmation of the virus from a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab on Wednesday night. The state veterinarian said it was possible the virus may have been tracked into the barns from fecal material left by infected wild birds. It's also possible for infected waterfowl to transmit the virus to shore birds that might then get into a turkey barn, he added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Authorities in Minnesota are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best as a deadly strain of bird flu wipes out a flock of 15,000 turkeys .\nIt is the same strain of H5N2 that has been found in wild birds across Washington, Oregon and Idaho .\nOnly 100 birds were left alive less than a week from the first deaths were reported .\nOfficials stress that the risk to humans is low and no infections from this strain have been detected anywhere ."}]}

The Ukip leader prompted a storm of controversy by suggesting he wanted to reverse legislation dating back to the 1960s which bars discrimination at work on the grounds of race or colour. His remarks were condemned by the leaders of the other three main parties. David Cameron said Mr Farage appeared ‘desperate for attention’, while Ed Miliband said the comments were ‘wrong, divisive and dangerous’. Nick Clegg said Mr Farage created fear by confusing ideas. Scroll down for video . 'Colour blind': Farage with Ukip election candidate Winston McKenzie at its conference last year . But a senior adviser to Downing Street went further, claiming Goebbels would have been ‘proud’ of Mr Farage’s remarks. Iraqi-born Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi, a member of the No 10 policy board, told LBC Radio: ‘The remark I found most difficult, and certainly hurt by, [is when] he talks about employers being able to discriminate in favour of British-born citizens. ‘I wasn’t born in Britain, but I feel equally British to Nigel Farage or anyone else. These remarks make me feel very frightened that a man like Nigel Farage, who aspires to lead the country, who says that he’s leading a serious party, actually takes the attitude that if you are not British-born, you’re not equal. It’s a dog whistle. 'It’s a remark Goebbels would be proud of. His remarks are deeply racist. He should withdraw and apologise.’ Last night the Ukip leader claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he did not want to scrap anti- discrimination legislation. Instead, he focused on less controversial suggestions that firms should be allowed to favour British job applicants. He said: ‘What I am saying is very simple: I’m saying that I think British companies should be allowed the presumption of favouring British applicants for jobs over those from southern and eastern Europe.’ Both Labour and Tory politicians, notably former prime minister Gordon Brown, have made similar proposals of a system of ‘British jobs for British workers’. The row erupted after Mr Farage, interviewed by Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for a Channel 4 documentary to be screened next week, said Britain faced an ‘especial problem’ with some Muslim immigrants. Iraqi-born Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon Nadhim Zahawi compared the Ukip leader to Goebbels while David Cameron said he was 'desperate for attention' ‘People do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us,’ he said. Mr Farage then suggested that race and other anti-discrimination laws could be abolished on the grounds that people were now ‘colour blind’. Pressed on which legislation he would get rid of, the Ukip leader said: ‘Much of it.’ Asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour if Ukip were ever in power, Mr Farage added: ‘No… because we take the view, we are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind. ‘I think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who she or he employs. I think the situation that we now have, where an employer is not allowed to choose between a British-born person and somebody from Poland, is a ludicrous state of affairs. ‘I would argue that the law does need changing, and that if an employer wishes to choose, or you can use the word “discriminate” if you want to, but wishes to choose to employ a British-born person, they should be allowed to do so.’ IN THE CHANNEL 4 INTERVIEW: . Trevor Phillips: ‘In Ukipland there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour?’ Nigel Farage: ‘No. We are colour blind. We as a party are colour blind.’ YESTERDAY: . Nigel Farage: ‘I didn’t mention race at all – it was no part of that interview with Trevor Phillips at all… I am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws in Britain.’ Challenged later about his remarks, the Ukip leader appeared to reverse his position, insisting: ‘I didn’t mention race at all. I am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws. I’m talking about lightening employment legislation so that small employers – and don’t forget, there are nearly five million in Britain – are less fearful of taking on young British workers.’ Mr Farage suggested his critics were racist, rather than him, since they assumed he meant ‘white’ when he talked about ‘British’ workers, while he insisted his proposed changes would help ‘young black and white British people’. Last night the Prime Minister said: ‘What Nigel Farage has said is completely wrong and, frankly, pretty appalling. The reason these laws are in place is to stop people being discriminated against on the basis of the colour of their skin.’ Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: ‘This is one of the most shocking things I have ever heard from a mainstream politician, and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance. ‘We have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country, but things are still far from perfect. ‘When my parents moved to London [from Pakistan] they frequently saw signs saying “no blacks, no dogs, no Irish”. What Ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nigel Farage was compared to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels over .\nUkip leader suggested he wanted to reverse race relation legislation .\nHis views slammed as 'dangerous, divisive and desperate for attention'\nIraqi-born MP said remarks was one 'Goebbels would have been proud of'\nNadhim Zahawi added he was 'hurt' and 'frightened' by Farage's view ."}]}

He said: 'The circumstances of the offence, the bitter suffering of [the mother] following the offence and the clear benefit to the victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother rendered this case truly exceptional. 'In short, despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign criminals, there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of the crime.

'In 2014, our YouTube income skyrocketed dramatically,' Mark told Yahoo Parents. 'We've made more than a million [dollars] between 2010 to 2014.' Scroll down for video . Home movies: Mark and Rhea, who prefer not to share their last name, filmed their daughter Maya, three, opening a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station for their popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya . Innocent adventure: The family's YouTube channel receives more than 3 million views daily . The father-of-three noted that they started their channel in 2007, but said that most of the old videos that they posted 'were junk'. They didn't begin sharing their money-making toy videos until three years later. The couple's most popular video was made in 2013 and features Hulyan buying a Thomas & Friends Emergency Searchlight set; the eight-minute clip has thus far earned more than 15.5 million views. Mark and Rhea, who are projected to earn at least $1.5 million this year, have since quit their jobs running an employment agency in order to pursue their lucrative YouTube careers full time. These days, they dedicate their time to filming, producing and sharing a minimum of two videos a day, which typically run for at least 15 minutes each. According to the duo, they've made so much money from the ads that air before each clip that they were able to pay for their cars and their house in Southern California in cash. They have even made enough to send all three of their children to college. Completely focused: The couple's son Hulyan can be seen playing a computer game . Ancient artifacts: The five-year-old can be seen opening a toy set filled with dinosaurs . And things don't seem to be slowing down. During the week of March 6, Hulyan Maya was ranked the 42nd most viewed YouTube channel in the US, according to Tubefilter, while a 20 minute video showing Maya unboxing a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station, has already earned nearly 400,000 views since it was published last month. Throughout the clip she and her father go through the toys various features while unwrapping each piece and putting them together. Most of the children’s biggest fans appear to be young children who are around the same age as Maya and her older brother Hulyan – and share the same keen interest in their toys. 'I love your videos they really cheer up my son,' one parent wrote. Another added: 'Seriously though! My son loves them too!' Family fun: Rhea held baby Marxlen as Hulyan and Maya enjoyed a train ride . Dedicated dad: Mark shared these photos of himself at the start of one of his popular videos . Mark and Rhea, who go by 'ilovemaythang' on their channel, moved from the Phillippines to the US in 2000 and 2006, respectively. Their children's love of toys, including Thomas the Tank Engine, is what first inspired Mark to make a channel dedicated to their home movies. But even Mark, who has been making video blogs since the early 1990s, admits he could not have predicted just how lucrative the family hobby would become. '[It] exceeded my expectations,' he told Yahoo Parents. 'I knew and believed that it would become somehow successful, but more than three million views in a day is simply amazing. I'm living a dream.' But their popularity shouldn't be that shocking - children's toy reviews have quickly become some of YouTube's most-watched videos. According to industry experts, children who review new toys on YouTube are wielding increasing influence over the industry because of their incredible viewing figures and ability to sell almost any toy around.

Marie Delanote, 34, didn't suspect a thing when her fourth child, Eloise, came into this world in May, 2012. In fact, she thought that she had soiled herself. It wasn’t until she noticed her baby’s head dangling between her legs that she realised in horror that it was arriving four months too early. Scroll down for video . Marie and her daughter Eloise, who is now almost three years old . She said: ‘I thought I was fine, but when I got up and went to the bathroom and my baby came out - it was extremely dramatic.’ Marie, who lives in Basildon, Essex, with her husband Andrew Seakins, 50, had already had three children; Jack, nine, Adam, eight, Orla Jane, four, by the time she fell pregnant with Eloise. So she knew that when her waters broke just after 23 weeks of pregnancy that something was very wrong. She said: ‘I didn't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term. 'I had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before, I had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant, which turned into streptococcus A. ‘Then ten days later I lost my mucus plug and I started wobbling – just three days later, my waters broke.’ Eloise in Neonatal Intensive Care at Portsmouth Hospital . Marie was rushed to Basildon hospital but the staff there were unable to deal with babies born more prematurely than 27 weeks and instead arranged for her to be admitted to Portsmouth hospital, two hours drive away. After administering her with an injection that helps babies to develop lungs in the womb quicker if they are at risk of premature birth, Marie was taken by ambulance to Portsmouth. Eloise weighed just 1lb when she was born . Once there, Marie had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred. She said: ‘I thought I had to go to the toilet - I thought I had been blocked for several days but unconsciously had not been wanting to let go because of the baby. ‘As I went into the bathroom, I thought I had defecated, but there was a mirror in front of the toilet and as I looked up, I saw this tiny little head between my legs, so I knew what was happening. ‘I pulled the emergency cord and within seconds, the midwives and the neonatal intensive care unit were there. ‘Two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver Eloise. ‘I didn't feel anything because she was so small. ‘She was as big as my hand, she fitted on my hand - she was really, really small. ‘Luckily I was in hospital because she was given to the doctors within seconds and they put breathing tubes in her.’ But being born so premature wasn’t the only battle facing Eloise, she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus A and B from her mother. Marie said: ‘She was infected by the streptococcus A and B, because in the meantime I had also developed streptococcus B. ‘So, as she came out and we weren't prepared, she picked that up too. ‘She was pus-covered, she was smelly, she made no attempts to breathe and she also had two small bleeds in her brain - it didn't look very positive.’ Marie practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the NHS . But while the future looked bleak for her daughter, Marie, who works as a spiritual healer, says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit, she was possessed by total calm. She said: ‘I had this spiritual calm come over me, knowing that I had to do the healing I've learnt and that all would be well. ‘The comments from the doctor weren't good because that's how the situation was, but I refused to have any negative dust in my mind.’ As the doctors used their traditional medicine on Eloise, Marie supplemented it with Reiki and what she called ‘psychic surgery’. She believes it was a combination of these two methods that enabled Eloise to fight through. Father Andrew with his daughter Eloise in hospital . Marie said: ‘I would do Reiki, which is universal energy giving. ‘It was like her physical battery was very low and mine was full, so by putting my hands on her, I charged her battery. ‘It comes from my head, through my hands, into her body and this made her able to fight better and overcome everything. ‘I would also do psychic surgery, which is healing with the mind. ‘I would imagine her blood with the bacteria in it and imagine sucking it out of the blood, so I can see it flowing beautifully. ‘It's all about the positive mind and intentions. ‘I strongly believe it was the collaboration between medical and spiritual healing that made her so good.’ When Eloise was taken home, she has to continue to be given oxygen . After four months and two days in hospital, Eloise was finally well enough to go home. Doctors took the precaution of hooking Eloise up to a portable oxygen tank for the following eight months. Marie said: ‘She was on home oxygen but an incredibly small amount - 0.02 of home oxygen so a very low flow. ‘But that's because it was in September and autumn was coming, so they took no risks. ‘It was quite difficult because a small baby is attached to oxygen anywhere you go. ‘You have a bottle underneath your pram and everyone is looking at you and wondering what's wrong with your baby. ‘She was on that until April - a month before her first birthday and then she just came off it.’ Eloise is now a healthy two year old girl . Marie (right) with Eloise, and her other children from left: Adam, eight, Jack, nine, and Orla Jane, four . Since then, the family haven’t looked back – Eloise is now as healthy as any other child her age. Marie said: ‘She sailed through for a baby who had given birth ill and so early. ‘One in ten who are born that prematurely are healthy and have no long term problems, but she wasn't just premature, she was also ill when she was born. ‘Most children born at this age have chronic lung disease, but she has been followed up by the NHS incredibly well.

Its executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s worrying that cereal bars, especially those aimed at children or claiming to be healthy, contain so much sugar but most don’t make this clear on the front of the pack. ‘We now want the Government to tackle this issue head on by making sure all manufacturers use traffic light nutrition labelling, encouraging reductions in sugar, fat and salt and ensuring manufacturers promote their products responsibly.’ The study found only one of the products, Mars’s Tracker Bar, had the ‘traffic light’ nutrition labelling making it clear to the buyer that the bars are high in sugar and fat.

A judge took a day out of court yesterday to visit the British Museum. But it wasn’t for an Easter holiday jolly around the exhibits. It was to help him rule in the case of an ancient statue which is said to have be smuggled out of war-torn Libya. The trial centres on a businessman who claimed in paper work that the treasure was a statue for home decoration. Experts, however say the Greek marble figure – which is thought to depict Persephone, goddess of the underworld – was looted from a world heritage site. While the man who had it delivered to a warehouse in West London claimed it was about 100 years old and worth around £75,000, they say it is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC. They claim it was intended for the lucrative private market in classical antiquities. Yesterday District Judge John Zani – accompanied by a gaggle of barristers and solicitors – went to inspect the statue at the British Museum, where it is being safeguarded in a basement till the conclusion of the case. Although the press were barred from the viewing, a video of it was later played in court which showed the judge circling the statue as marks were pointed out to him. He was told stains and other evidence meant it was ‘definitely’ excavated illegally from the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene – once known as the Athens of Africa. It is said to have been smuggled out of Libya via Dubai in 2011 before being discovered by UK customs officials two years later. Libya has been plagued by looting and cultural vandalism since the fall of Colonel Gaddaffi in 2011, with the resulting power vacuum effectively ending the state-sponsored preservation of the country’s multiple Greek and Roman sites. The sculpture is said to have originally served as a grave marker and displays unusual iconography including snake-like bracelets and a doll-type figurine. Jordanian national Riad Al Qassas – who is not in court – is accused of falsifying paperwork after he told customs that the sculpture came from Turkey. Dr Peter Higgs, curator of Greek sculpture at the museum, told the judge the statue was in ‘the top ten’ of its class. Caught in a lie: Experts at the British Museum, pictured, say the statue is worth £2million and dates from the third to first centuries BC . He said: ‘I believe the statue was definitely made in Libya, in Cyrenaica’, adding it was extremely rare. He added that his valuation of £2million had been made on 2011 prices, but said there were no directly comparable examples from auction house records. Andrew Bird, for HMRC, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that academics had decided ‘on the balance of probabilities, this statue had been unlawfully excavated from a UNESCO world heritage site’. He said documents suggested Al Qassas had only a marginal role in the export, placing the blame with Hassan Fazeli, a Dubai businessman who has claimed the sculpture has belonged to his family collection since 1977. Ben Watson, who represents Al Qassas, indicated his client would be happy to hand over the sculpture to Tripoli if it was shown to originate from there. Al Qassas denies knowingly or recklessly delivering a false document to HMRC. The case continues.

High-profile incidents suffered by players during the current Six Nations — including Wales wing George North, England full-back Mike Brown and Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien — have reignited concerns over the extent of concussion in professional rugby and how the potentially fatal injury is handled. A recent RFU audit revealed reported rates of concussion were 59 per cent higher during the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season than the previous year, with 10.5 concussions occurring every 1,000 player hours. Full-back Mike Brown suffered a heavy blow to the head in England's victory over Italy . But figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show the rate of reported concussions for the current Six Nations stand at 25 per 1,000 player hours after three rounds — more than double the RFU’s figure and almost 10 times the number reported a decade ago. ‘It’s a massively high number and it’s causing significant concern across the sport,’ said one insider at the governing body, World Rugby. ‘Something needs to be done because the World Cup is coming up and the eyes of the world will be on rugby. Concussion is unquestionably the biggest issue facing the sport.’ Significant strides have been made by the sport’s governing bodies in recent times, with a compulsory education programme introduced in the Aviva Premiership at the start of this season and a gradual introduction of pitch-side video technology for medics to access. Brown was ruled out of Ireland game after failing stage three of the return to play concussion protocol – a process all players must undergo after suffering head injuries . World Rugby bosses, aware of potentially damaging long-term effects of multiple concussions to players and desperate to avoid potentially crippling legal action seen in the NFL, have also instituted an extensive education programme. And they are in the processes of drawing up a legally binding document to ensure strict player welfare guidelines are adhered to at the World Cup. But there are fears the current measures do not go far enough and The Mail on Sunday understands World Rugby chiefs have agreed the introduction of further medical protocols ahead of the World Cup which include: . Wales admitted George North should have been removed from play after being knocked unconscious . Rugby union has been on high alert since the NFL agreed to pay out close to a billion dollars to more than 4,000 former gridiron stars with neurodegenerative conditions linked to multiple concussions and the latest figures will do little to ease concern. This week, World Rugby’s head of medicine Dr Martin Raftery presented to the world governing body’s executive committee when the proposal to draw up a worldwide group of players, coaches, referees, doctors and medics with a remit to look at law changes to reduce concussion rates was ratified. ‘We are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem,’ said Dr Raftery. ‘If we had started the prevention programmes five years ago, we would have been saying, “We need to get it down from five [concussions per 1,000 hours]. Now we know it’s going to be at least 10.5 if not more and I think we’ll see another increase. We are getting far better compliance around concussion but we don’t believe we have finished this process. We’ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area. If there’s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we’ll investigate it.’ There was widespread criticism of the Wales medical team for failing to spot two incidents in which North appeared to be knocked unconscious but was allowed to play on. A World Rugby concussion panel — comprising Dr Raftery and some of the world’s leading brain injury experts — accepted the Welsh medical team’s explanation that they were unsighted for both incidents, although questions remain as to why no one among the team’s backroom staff, some with access to BBC broadcast footage, alerted the medics. ‘The Welsh didn’t have to co-operate but they were extremely co-operative,’ said Raftery. ‘They were also extremely embarrassed about what happened.’ Concerns also persist that so-called ‘independent’ match-day doctors in the Six Nations are often employees of the home union and therefore highly unlikely to challenge or even over-rule a team doctor if they believe a serious breach in protocol has occurred. ‘They will have to be fully independent match-day doctors at the World Cup,’ said Raftery. ‘Every other match day appointment is independent so why not doctors? Imagine if England were playing Australia and the match-day doctor was English and decided that Israel Folau should come off with 20 minutes left even if the Wallaby team doctors said he was fine. There would be absolute outcry. We have to avoid that scenario. ‘The match day doctor has the ability to over-rule team doctors but I’d hope they would look to work together.’ Exeter Chiefs have announced a new research programme to investigate effects of concussion on their players, while Saracens are also trialling micro-chip technology to assess the extent of forces their players are being exposed to."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reported concussions for current Six Nations are more than double the rate for the the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season .\nHigh-profile incidents suffered by players during the current Six Nations have reignited concerns .\nGeorge North, Mike Brown and Sean O'Brien all suffered concussion .\nsanctioning and possible suspension of team doctors found to have breached concussion protocols through an ‘untoward incident review panel’\nindependent pitch-side doctors and neurologists with no affiliation to either team’s union with the right to over-rule team doctors .\nbaseline cognitive testing for every participating player and compulsory medical screening .\nidentification of high-risk players with a history of concussions .\nassembly of a sport-wide group looking at law changes to reduce concussion rates .\nreal-time television replays available for all pitch-side medics to assess head injuries ."}]}

Researchers found they managed surprisingly well, using other ants or the surfaces and walls as anchors to climb. However, their ability to search collectively did not go perfectly as they tumbled and fell while trying to explore. Scroll down for video . A team in California studied ants in zero gravity on the ISS. Astronauts were asked to monitor the ants in eight habitats on the station. Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio is seen here observing the activities of the Ants In Space CSI-06 investigation aboard the International Space Station . The study, Collective Search by Ants in Microgravity, was published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. The ants were taken to the station in January 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board. Ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. ‘We had no idea what the ants would do. We didn't know if they would be able to search at all,’ said Professor Deborah Gordon, a biologist at Stanford University, to the BBC. The experiment used eight different habitats in total, with each containing 80 common pavement ants. As barrier doors between the different sections were opened, the ants dispersed to search the new area. The astronauts then recorded the habitats with an HD video camera. A control experiment was carried out on Earth, and the results - perhaps unsurprisingly - showed that those on the ground were much better at searching than those in space. In fact, the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space, as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time. At any one moment, the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around. The Ants In Space CSI-06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the International Space Station to solve their collective need for resources. Data gathered from this study may help with algorithms for robotics on Earth. ‘The ants did not perform collective search as effectively in microgravity as they did in the ground controls,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. ‘Because ants in microgravity did not use straighter paths or traverse more distance when the area to be searched expanded, they did not search the area thoroughly.’ The researchers noted that one of the reasons the ants struggled to explore their might have been that they were unable to interact with others easily. However, it was not all bad news; the ants showed an ‘impressive ability to walk on the surface in microgravity, and an even more remarkable capacity to regain their contact with the surface once they were tumbling around in the air.’ The ants also made efforts to remain in contact with the surface. The ultimate goal, though, was to see how they could overcome problems in their collective search method - such as in a human-dominated environment - something which the ants adapted to fairly well. These might not be the most famous ants in space you remember: Homer, in the 15th episode of the fifth season of The Simpsons (Deep Space Homer) accidentally crashes in to an ant colony while in space (shown)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Researcher in California studied ants in zero gravity on the ISS .\nAstronauts were asked to monitor the ants in eight habitats on the station .\nWhen the ants tried to search, they struggled to keep their grip .\nSome remained floating around for up to eight seconds at a time ."}]}

With a 117-107 thrashing of the Toronto Raptors, the Spurs have won six straight games behind the contributions of Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard. Parker totaled 23 points and nine assists, which means he's surpassed the 20-point threshold in each of the Spurs' last three games. San Antonio are 11-2 when Parker compiles at least 20 points this season.

Now, with their vision of a global schedule as a viable alternative to the American behemoth having survived intact, the European Tour is set to embark on the next phase in its development. I can reveal negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the PGA of Australia for some sort of merger. Whether this means an arrangement similar to that with the Sunshine Tour in South Africa — where seven events are co-sanctioned — or something more formal has yet to be determined. But it’s surely good news for European Tour members, who were given an outline of the plans at the Qatar Masters recently. If events with the prestige of the Australian Open, the Aussie Masters and the Australian PGA Championship made their way on to the schedule in December, it would be a significant upgrade on the slim offerings at the moment. The Australian Open, last won by Jordan Spieth, could make its way onto the tour their schedule in December . As well as here in Europe, there are events in America, Asia, South Africa and the Middle East that all count towards the Race to Dubai, seen here with 2014 winner Rory McIlroy . For their part, the PGA of Australia have the titles and golf courses but linking up with the European Tour would surely help in terms of improving strength of fields and attracting sponsors. Australia is just about the only great golf playing region the European Tour will not visit this year as part of its international schedule. As well as here in Europe, there are events in America, Asia, South Africa and the Middle East that all count towards the Race to Dubai. The addition of some Australian events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of Patrick Reed . The two tours did co-sanction one event on the 2014 schedule in Perth but any merger this time is likely to encompass a number of tournaments. Naturally, there will never be any serious competition between the European and PGA Tours in terms of the size of prize funds. In America, they give away $1million-plus first prizes every week and there’s no matching that. But to young Americans with ambition, the addition of some seriously good Aussie events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of Patrick Reed and the leading Europeans and sign up to enjoy the best of both worlds. Only Tiger Woods and Sam Snead have ever won the same event on eight different occasions on the PGA Tour, so you can only imagine how low the former must be feeling about his chipping yips to skip this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he has been such a serial champion. How cruel that his severe bout of stage fright now precludes him from even making it to the first tee. As for the Masters and all those tight Augusta lies, the question is rapidly changing from whether Tiger (right) can make it to a sense of foreboding if he did. Tiger Woods has been out of action since the beginning of February when he withdrew midway through his first round at the Farmers Insurance Open due to back pain . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘I’m looking forward to getting there and seeing my grandad. It’s going to be a great week. I’m in the field on merit and playing well.’ It’s taken a while but 27-year-old Sam Saunders is slowly emerging from the shadow of his grandfather, the host this week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Saunders has finished runner-up and tied 24th in his last two PGA Tour starts and will compete in the event for the first time as a fully-fledged card holder, rather than on a sponsor’s exemption. Sam Saunders acknowledges the crowd on the 18th green during the final round of the Valspar Championship on Sunday . Spieth leading the US charge to crash McIlroy’s date with destiny . Jordan Spieth makes no secret of the fact he’s got Rory McIlroy in his sights and, excitingly for the sport, he not only talks a good game but plays it as well. The 21-year-old Texan displayed great skill and considerable resolve to prevail in a marvellous shootout against fellow Americans Patrick Reed and Sean O’Hair to win the Valspar Championship in overtime in Florida on Sunday. It was his third win in his last eight events, and he became just the fourth golfer aged 22 or under to have two victories to his name on the PGA Tour in the last 70 years. Spieth (right) achieved it in a manner that augurs well for his chances next month of going one better than his remarkable runner-up performance on his Masters debut last year. He got down in two from any number of unfavourable spots before holing a 28ft birdie putt to win on the third extra hole. Spieth has World No 1 Rory McIlroy in his sights following his Valspar Championship success . ‘Rory is the man who has picked up Tiger’s mantle and he is the one I am focused on,’ said Spieth, now up to a career-high sixth in the world. With the season’s first major just three weeks away, the cream of this generation of American golfers have certainly laid down a marker, with the performances of Spieth and Reed in this event following Dustin Johnson’s victory over current Masters champ Bubba Watson in Miami the previous Sunday. Now who should re-enter the fold at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this week but McIlroy himself. This is his last scheduled tournament before his date with history at the Masters.

But the latest design will test even the most methodical puzzler. Each of the 1,000 pieces in the '1000 Colours' puzzle is a completely different colour to the next and they have to be placed according to the CMYK system. '1000 Colours'  (show) was designed by illustrator Clemens Habicht. Each of its 1,000 pieces are a different colour on the CMYK system. CMYK refers to cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) inks used in printing . CMYK refers to the four inks typically used in colour printing - cyan, magenta, yellow, and key or black. The puzzle was designed by Paris-based graphic artist Clemens Habicht. Mr Habicht said: 'The idea came from enjoying the subtle differences in the blue of a sky in a particularly brutal jigsaw puzzle. 'I found that without the presence of image detail to help locate a piece, I was relying only on an intuitive sense of colour.

'Unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' Mr Habicht said . 'And this was much more satisfying to do than the areas with image details.' And despite being touted as the world's most difficult puzzle, Mr Habicht said it is easier than it first appear. 'What is strange is that unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference, you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece,' he said. The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm) and it costs $70 AUD (£36). Limited numbers of the jigsaw are available from Australian company Lamington Drive . The current run of 1000 Colour (pieces pictured) is the second edition of the puzzle. It first went on sale last year, and the firm said it is working on producing a third . It had previously been thought the human eye couldn't see infrared light. However, researchers have revealed that under certain conditions, the retina can sense infrared light after all. An international team of researchers used cells from the retinas of mice and people. By firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that  light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy. When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum. 'There is a real logic in doing that. It is weirdly soothing and therapeutic. 'As each piece clicks perfectly into place, just so, it's a little win - like a little pat on the back.' The completed puzzle measures 19 inches (50cm) by 27 inches (70cm).

Capturing footage of himself on a GoPro camera, Cezary Romanowski documented his experiences over a period of several months. The video begins with Cezary, a tree surgeon from Poland, sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland. Suitably prepared, Cezary ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes – also known as gaffs or spurs – attached to his chainsaw boots. What follows is a fast-paced montage sequence showing Cezary dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes. Sawing through a particularly large trunk, the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw – while its teeth continue to rotate – and reaching for a wedge. Cezary is filmed sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw before filling it with fuel in a snowy wooded area . Cezary prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top . Jamming it in the gap, Cezary makes his way around the tree, systematically tapping the wedge in further as he goes, until the crane is able to lift the top of the trunk away.

The tree surgeon cuts through a huge trunk with ease while using a wedge to help him . Tree surgeons, or arborists as they are formally known, cultivate, manage and study individual trees, shrubs and vines. Their job therefore differs to that of a logger or a forester, who focus on large areas of woodland. Often dangerous, tree surgeons are sometimes required to work near power wires but may also plan, consult, write reports and give legal testimony. In the UK, arborists can gain qualifications up to and including a Master's degree.

A survey of real estate agents around the country revealed that 60% believe the Australian dream of owning your home is becoming less obtainable, and young Australians could be forced to rent long-term as residential property prices jumped an average of 6.8% in the last 12 months. One Gen Y couple who have been struggling to purchase their first property are Katherine Ross, 29, and her partner Hauaru Gilbert, who have been looking seriously for the past twelve months to buy a house in Sydney. Scroll down for video . Artemis Paniaras, a recruitment consultant and her fiancee William, a sales manager, are both in their mid-20s and recently purchased a house after facing significant challenges . The capital city saw a staggering price increase of 12.2% over the past twelve months, which Ms Ross said has been  the greatest barrier to buying their own home. 'The prices are really pushing us out of the market. The sellers market keeps going higher and even two bedroom apartments are a minimum of $700,000,' Ms Ross told Daily Mail Australia. According to a nationwide survey, conducted by real estate agent ranking and reviews platform OpenAgent, 75% of real estate agents believe that property prices are going to continue to increase over the next twelve months. The strongest growth in property price for 2015 is expected on the East coast with New South Wales only slightly ahead of Queensland, then followed by Victoria. Ms Ross and her partner both work in Sydney's Eastern suburbs, and would ideally like to live close to their jobs but have been unable to find anything in their budget. 'We may have to look further out, which makes it very frustrating when discussing where we want to live,' she said. Ms Paniaras said that she and her partner weren't taken seriously by estate agents when looking at properties . One of the elements of the process they found difficult was not having professional advice available to them . Sydney's Lord Mayor described the property market in Sydney as a 'housing crisis'. 'Many young people can no longer afford to buy into the housing market. There are people suffering housing stress,' Cr Moore said. 'For our future socio and economic prosperity we can no longer afford to shift the chronic housing issue to the too hard basket,' she said at Fixing Sydney's Housing Problems. National: $648,315 .

'Not only for the sake of future generations but present ones as well,' reported Domain. 'The dream of owning your own home is still important for most Australians and we’re seeing that people are willing to forgo on the luxury of location to keep it alive,' said co-founder and co-CEO of OpenAgent, Zoe Pointon. Artemis Paniaras, a recruitment consultant and her fiancee William, a sales manager, are both in their mid-20s and faced different barriers when purchasing their first home. 'Real estate agents wouldn't take us seriously when we turned up to open house inspections,' Ms Paniaras said. 'They wouldn't talk to me or show any interest, even though we had enough for a deposit,' she said.

Ms Paniaras and her fiancee were originally looking for a renovated property but soon realised that was out of their price range, and decided to spend $25 renovating themselves .

Both couples said that one of the elements of the process that they found difficult was not having any professional advice available to them when looking to buy a property. 'We want help from local agents to work out areas that are realistic for our budget,' said Ms Ross. 'That would be such a help and be a huge first step. We just aren't receiving any advice,' she said. Ms Pointon said that it is crucial for young Australians who are looking to buy a property that they look for an agent who is informed about the local area. 'Whether you’re purchasing or selling a property, it’s likely to be the biggest financial transaction you will make over the course of your life,' Ms Pointon said. 'With the predicted increase in prices, people can’t afford to be making blind choices about finding an agent to navigate the market for them. What’s critical here is that both buyers and sellers ensure they are working with an agent who really gets the local market,' she said.

The endangered kitten, who has not yet been named and is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo, has just began to open his eyes and hasn't even taken his first step. And when zoo staff members wash him in the sink and feed him with a bottle, he's as cute as ever. The ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten, who has yet to be named, is being fed and watched over by staff at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida . Staff members said he has barely opened his eyes, has yet to walk and will be watched 'round-the-clock' for the next few months . The kitten is given 'round-the-clock' care where he'll be fed and watched after for about three months by staff, according toFOX Tampa Bay. He is expected to start walking in about two weeks, and zoo staff will determine his future home in the next few weeks. Four-year-old clouded leopards Yim and Malee were paired as potential mates in 2011, when they arrived at the zoo, by the Clouded Leopard Species Survival Plan, which supports the conservation of the endangered animal. They then conceived their first born - the kitten who was born this month. Vice President of animal science and conservation at the zoo Dr Larry Killmar said the birth 'signifies a milestone accomplishment' for the conservation programs. 'Species survival programs for animals like the clouded leopards take years of planning, development and staff commitment. The kitten will contribute to the long-term viability of our conservation efforts within the managed population,' Killmar told FOX. The kitten is expected to start walking in a couple weeks. He is the baby of two four-year-old clouded leopards at the zoo who were matched as potential mates in 2011 by a conservation group . The clouded leopard is an endangered species and it is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all new born kittens . Clouded leopards are the smallest of the 'big cats', weighing between 30 and 50lb when fully grown. The cat - the most talented climbers among the cats - is classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and its total population is no more than 10,000. This is down to factors such as deforestation, illegal trading and poaching commercially. Some parts, such as claws, skin and teeth are also consumed for decoration purposes. As such, it is important to do as much as possible to ensure the health and well-being of the threatened animal. It is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all newborn clouded leopards. The cat is most commonly found in the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The kitten is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida .\nSince he's only ten day old, he's given 'round-the-clock care' by staff .\nHe is the kitten of two four-year-old leopards who were paired up in 2011 as potential mates by a conservation organization .\nClouded leopards are classified as 'vulnerable' by the ICUN .\nIt is therefore common practice to hand-raise new cubs in zoos ."}]}

The couple arrived in Washington on Tuesday evening. Many people will remember Charles from the day in July 1981 when, as a dashing young prince, he kissed his shy bride, Diana, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in front of the eyes of the world. But many things have changed since then, including their divorce, Diana's death in a car accident in 1997 and his marriage to Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall. Here are five things to know about the Prince of Wales: . While a lot of attention in recent years has been focused on his sons, Princes William and Harry, Charles is next in line to the British throne. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, has ruled for more than 60 years (in fact, in September she is expected to overtake her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria for the title of Britain's longest-reigning monarch.) Her longevity is welcomed by her subjects, but it means that Charles, at age 66, has spent a long time as a monarch-in-waiting. He's also now a grandfather, thanks to the birth of Prince George in 2013. Charles and Camilla tied the knot on April 9, 2005. The couple first visited the United States together as newlyweds, and Camilla was confronted by hard-core Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%. But there's been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by ComRes for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago. In an exclusive interview with CNN royal correspondent Max Foster, Charles opened up about the couple's relationship. He met Camilla years before he wed Diana, who famously said in a 1995 BBC TV interview that \"there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" Reporter's notebook: Interviewing the royal couple . The prince has admitted talking to his plants in past TV interviews, inviting ridicule from some quarters. But as part of his interest in sustainability, he has championed organic farming and gardening for many years, including on his large country estates. He has a fully functioning organic farm at Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, England, and founded his own organic food brand, Duchy Originals, which now turns a healthy profit and helps fund his charitable foundation. According to his official website, he's an advocate of traditional rural skills and enjoys hedge laying. Charles has riled some people over the years with his outspoken views on architecture, which prioritize the traditional over the modern. In 1984, he made headlines when he described a proposed modern extension to the National Gallery in London as \"a monstrous carbuncle,\" according to news reports from the time. He's also invited controversy by reportedly writing to ministers -- and even the Prime Minister -- on subjects close to his heart. This intervention in the public sphere has troubled those who believe the royals should not get involved in such debates and worry that, once king, Charles may not remain above politics in the way that his mother has. In a piece published by The Architectural Review in December, Charles explained his thinking on architecture, saying \"designing places according to the human scale and with Nature at the heart of the process has always been my central concern.\" The future king has often been photographed on the ski slopes of Europe and in the past has also tried his hand at water skiing, surfing and scuba diving. He was a keen polo player for more than four decades, only retiring from the sport in 2005. This is despite breaking his arm in two places when he fell off a pony during a polo match in 1990. He also climbed in the saddle as a jockey on a number of occasions. His website also describes him as an \"experienced watercolourist\" who likes to paint in the open air at home and on his travels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, are visiting the United States .\nCharles, an advocate of organic farming and traditional architecture, is heir to British throne ."}]}

Nick Knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic McQueen Black Event in 2004. The London show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces, some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night. Scroll down for video . Fashion photographer Nick Knight has created a stunning series of images created from backstage photographs of Alexander McQueen's 2004 show . Now using material he shot backstage at the event, Mr Knight has now created the unique image called Black, collating the previously unseen photographs of 35 outfits modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gemma Ward and Lily Cole among others. Mr Knight says he was asked by McQueen to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future, and now, more than a decade later, the designer’s vision has now been realised. Mr Knight said: ‘As a close collaborator and friend of McQueen, I had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-Nineties onwards.’ 'McQueen was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the American Express Black event, he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at Earls Court where the show was being held. 'He knew the Black Event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world, so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship. Models including Kate Moss, Lily Cole and Naomi Campbell were all captured backstage wearing McQueen costumes for the tableaux which has been broken down into four sections . Nick Knight has turned the previously unseen pictures into a dramatic tableaux . ‘We both knew we had the ingredients to make an incredible image.’ The image, commissioned by American Express, has been released to coincide with the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition currently showing at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Lisa Gregg, vice president, American Express, said: ‘Alexander McQueen was renowned for pushing creative boundaries and this was always demonstrated through his legendary work. American Express supported McQueen in his early years as a trailblazing creative, and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name. ‘Our partnership with the V&A and the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with Nick again and to commission this beautiful image, which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with McQueen.’ McQueen was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs. The retrospective of his work at the V&A features items taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. Savage Beauty, which runs until August 2, includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by McQueen's friends, among them stylist Katy England. The tableaux, called Black, have been released to complement the Alexander McQueen:Savage Beauty retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London . Talented: McQueen, pictured left, during his spring/summer 2006 show and, right, his friend and fashion photographer Nick Knight . McQueen, who was found dead on the 11 February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. Spectacular: A curator puts the final touches to some of the dresses on display at the V&A . Striking: His pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion-buying public alike . Hard to walk in: His shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in, as several models discovered while on the catwalk . Finishing touches: A curator works on an exhibit (left), while right, one of the structured gowns for which McQueen became famous . Last pieces: These designs are taken from McQueen's S/S10 collection which was inspired by sea creatures . From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans. The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital. Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.' The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series. But it is the new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show. Enfant terrible: One of McQueen's more shocking stunts involved spraying model Shalom Harlow with paint during his S/S98 show . Striking: A V&A assistant poses next to a dress taken from McQueen's The Girl Who Lived In The Tree A/W 2008 collection . Magnificent: As with his shoes, the headgear shown on the catwalk by McQueen was usually difficult to wear . Changing times: McQueen's sea creature inspired S/S10 collection (left) and a dress from his A/W08 Widows of Culloden collection . Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create. His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength. 'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.' 'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth. 'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.' Dramatic:  McQueen was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses . Spectacular: Victoriana and bold blooms were also recurring motifs, as these striking gowns make plain . Setting the scene: Savage Beauty opens at the V&A next month, with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th March . The stars turned out in force for the party the V&A held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition. Supermodels including Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Erin O'Connor all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer. A-List names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs, including Colin Firth and Laura Carmichael, while David and Victoria Beckham put in an appearance too.

Creator Julian Fellowes is developing another period drama, \"The Gilded Age,\" for NBC and has been noncommittal about how much longer the show might endure beyond season six, which is filming now. \"It won't go on forever -- I'm not a believer in that,\" he told The New York Times in a recent interview. \"But I can't immediately now tell you where the end will be.\" It is hard to imagine \"Downton,\" which just wrapped its fifth season on PBS in the United States, without the wit and wisdom of Lady Violet, whose acerbic commentary leaves few around her unscathed. So let's hope Smith just misspoke. And until season six, which airs this fall in the UK and early next year in the United States, here are some of our favorite Dowager Countess zingers. -- Isobel: \"How you hate to be wrong.\" Lady Violet: \"I wouldn't know, I'm not familiar with the sensation.\" -- Robert: \"They do say there's a wild man inside all of us.\" Lady Violet: \"If only he would stay inside.\" -- Isobel: \"I admire it when young people stand up for their principles.\" Lady Violet: \"Principles are like prayers; noble, of course, but awkward at a party.\" -- Lady Violet (to Cora): \"I'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again. When I'm with her, I'm reminded of the virtues of the English.\" Matthew: \"But isn't she American?\" Lady Violet: \"Exactly.\" -- Isobel: \"I take that as a compliment.\" Lady Violet: \"I must have said it wrong.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maggie Smith causes fuss by saying next season of  \"Downton Abbey\" may be her last .\nSuch speculation was hurriedly squashed by a \"Downton\" publicist .\nHere are some of our favorite dowager countess zingers from the show ."}]}

Now, aged 78 and in poor health, it is both himself and his legacy - a historic archive of iconic photographs spanning 60 years - that could be lost forever. In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph ‘John Lennon with Panda’ is today being re-released and available at www.freemanarchive.com as a limited edition A2 or A3 archival C-type metallic print. In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph 'John Lennon with Panda' is today being re-released to raise funds for its photographer Robert Freeman's care . The exclusive sale organised by his son Dean Freeman will end 15 May 2015, raising vital funds for Robert’s ongoing care as well as the preservation of a body of work that captured the likes of his personal friend, Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, Sophia Loren, Marianne Faithful and Jimmy Cliff. Due to the proud and eccentric nature of a great artist, Robert has refused all family help and this is Dean’s way of maintaining his father’s dignity and saving his priceless archive. Due to the proud and eccentric nature of Robert, whose work includes this picture of Andy Warhol called Rome from 1972, he has refused all family help . After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times  and went on to capture pictures like this montage of Jimmy Cliff in 1966 . As well as capturing five Beatles album covers and the first-ever Pirelli calendar, Robert's work also includes this grainy shot of Charlton Heston in 1962 . All previous reproductions of his work have sold for thousands of pounds so this auction is set to raise a huge sum. Robert became close to the Beatles at the height of their fame, and it is this mutual intimacy that gave him unprecedented access to capture their lives through a series of beautifully grainy black and white photographs. Speaking about Robert, Paul McCartney once said: 'Although other people were taking photos of us at the time, I think we all felt that his stuff somehow summed up our own feelings. His photos were among the best ever taken of the Beatles.' After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times and other magazines. As well as musicians, he worked with athletes, including Cassius Clay a.k.a Muhammad Ali, captured in 1964 . He also worked with The Beatles in their feature film debut, A Hard Day's Night . One of his assignments was photographing jazz musicians at a London jazz festival, helping him to develop a portfolio including portraits of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy Gillespie, Elvin Jones, and Coleman Hawkins. These were the photos he sent to Beatles manager, Brian Epstein, in the summer of 1963. In addition to being the Beatles’ most favoured photographer, Robert directed television and film commercials and two feature films: The Touchables and Secret World. Dean Freeman, a successful director who has published more than 10 works on various stars and once worked as the Spice Girls' official photographer, said: 'My father is extremely frail, living alone in a small hostel and is in desperate need of care. 'He can no longer look after his valuable archive of work that is falling into disrepair. All proceeds of our exclusive sale will help him recuperate and preserve his wonderful images and stories. 'It would be heartbreaking to see this irreplaceable body of work lost to future generations.'

The Eugene woman was being treated for critical injuries at a Portland-area hospital. The woman's family had recently reported her missing, police spokesman John Hankemeier said. A 911 caller reported Thursday afternoon that a car appeared to be on fire from the inside, with the woman at the wheel driving recklessly, The Register-Guard newspaper reported. Scene: A 39-year-old woman apparently set herself on fire intentionally while behind the wheel of this Hyundai, crashed her car on a bridge and then jumped 40 feet to a park below. She is now in a critical condition . After the car crashed into a bridge guardrail, witnesses told police the woman jumped out — while on fire — and began taking her clothes off as she ran to the edge of the span. Truck drivers tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and a female driver who stopped at the scene tried to grab the woman from the edge, but she was still able to jump, police said.

Mozan praised the female passer-by who attempted to save the woman. 'Her efforts were nothing less than heroic,' he said. When the car crashed, a piece of its bumper sailed over the bridge, injuring a 40-year-old woman below. Investigation: Police say they were able to piece together the events that lead to the woman being found in a park below this bridge thanks to accounts from witnesses . The pedestrian was treated for minor injuries, police said. The car was still engulfed in flames when police arrived, Mozan said. It appeared an accelerant had been used inside the vehicle. The accident damaged the bridge and traffic was backed up for almost two hours. The fire and crash remain under investigation.

We all find noise annoying – but if it really bothers you it could be because you're a genius. Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin and Franz Kafka – who both complained of their difficulty of filtering out noise – research has revealed. Psychologists now believe that an inability to shut out irrelevant sensory information could be strongly linked to creativity. French writer Marcel Proust was famous for wearing earplugs and lining his bedroom with cork to block out the outside sound while he worked. And Kafka once said 'I need solitude for my writing; not \"like a hermit\" - that wouldn't be enough - but like a dead man.' Darwin and write Anton Chekhov were also known to have complained about how they found it difficult to filter out noise. Scientists at Northwestern University, Illinois, tested 100 people on their ability to find original solutions to problems and found strong links between an inability to shut out irrelevant audio stimuli, dubbed 'leaky' sensory gating, and creativity. In tests 100 people were provided solutions to scenarios, with the challenge of coming up with as many original answers as possible. This was designed to measure their level of 'real world creative achievement'. The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychologia, suggest those with the affliction might find it easier to think creatively as they can focus on a wide range of things simultaneously. Darya Zabelina, a PhD psychology student at Northwestern University in Illinois said: 'If funnelled in the right direction, these sensitivities can make life more rich and meaningful, giving experiences more subtlety.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Inability to shut out irrelevant sounds could be linked to creativity .\nBeing overly sensitive to sounds could be key to genius, scientists say .\nCharles Darwin among great minds who complained about too much noise ."}]}

The Utah Department of Public Safety imposed the discipline in December on Rob Wilkinson, a Utah Highway Patrol sergeant, and Justin Hansen, a State Bureau of Investigation agent. The department released its discipline records last week after receiving a request to obtain them by The Salt Lake Tribune. Wilkinson, who received a three-day suspension, and Hansen, who received a one-day suspension, were at the Big Shot Ranch near Grantsville in June when British bikini models posed for photos and were videotaped firing guns for a calendar called 'Hot Shots.' The two men were seen wearing camouflage uniforms identifying them as police in a promotional video filmed at Camp Williams in May and posted on YouTube in October. Scroll down for video . Risque: The models were at Camp Williams for a Hot Shots pinup calendar and behind-the-scenes video shoot. Two Utah peace officers were disciplined as a result . Exposed: Men were spotted in the promotional video wearing camouflage gear with 'police' on the back . Neither Wilkinson nor Hansen sought their superiors' permission to participate, and superiors learned of the activity only when they saw video clips played by the news media in Utah, according to the records. The men were disciplined for conduct that brings discredit to an officer or agency, and for wearing their uniform during a promotion for a product — both rules violations, the records show. Wilkinson and Hansen declined comment. An acquaintance asked the two to help supervise the firing line where the models shot at targets, according to an internal affairs report.

In a second pink champagne-fuelled interview in consecutive days, the former SNP leader pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament. Mr Salmond said the SNP would back Labour regardless of any formal deal, but said his party would make 'progressive amendments' to the Budget and other legislation – code for higher taxes and Left-wing policies. The Prime Minister seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Mr Miliband as 'Alex Salmond's poodle'. Scroll down for video . Controversial: In a 'champagne-fuelled interview', former SNP leader Alex Salmond (pictured) pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament . Lap dog: Prime Minister David Cameron seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Labour Leader Ed Miliband (pictured) as 'Alex Salmond's poodle' 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note,' he said. 'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence. 'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation – and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.' Mr Salmond's latest intervention also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon. As her predecessor stole her limelight again, Scotland's First Minister attempted to stamp her authority on the party, insisting: 'I'm the leader of the SNP.' In an interview with the Spectator magazine – during which he guzzled pink champagne for a second consecutive day – Mr Salmond said his MPs would vote to kick out the Tories whether they secure concessions from Labour or not. 'The SNP approach to a Cameron minority government will be to bring it down,' he said. In an interview with the New Statesman the previous day, Mr Salmond again ordered a bottle of pink champagne, ostensibly to celebrate the publication of his book on last year's referendum campaign. On the offensive: Mr Cameron said: 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note' Not amused: Mr Salmond's latest interview also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon (left), who declared 'I'm the leader of the SNP' in a bid to reassert her authority . Mr Salmond, who also revealed that he 'identifies' with Nelson Mandela, said the SNP would join forces with Labour to vote down any Queen's Speech put forward by a minority Conservative government. The SNP is riding high in the polls and experts predict the party could win as many as 50 of Scotland's 59 seats, making it potentially the third biggest party at Westminster. Labour will 'redistribute' hundreds of millions of pounds from England to Scotland if it wins the election, the party's leader north of the border boasted yesterday. Jim Murphy pledged in a speech in the City of London to use money raided from the pensions of better-off workers in England to pay for a 'jobs guarantee' for young people in Scotland, and higher bursaries for Scottish students. Mr Murphy has already angered voters in England by boasting that he will use the proceeds of a mansion tax in the South East to pay for an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland. A Scottish Labour source said that, unlike the SNP, it could promise to raise taxes in England and spend them in Scotland. 'This announcement means two of Scottish Labour's first three election pledges will be funded by money raised from the more prosperous parts of the UK.' Mr Salmond, who is expected to return to Westminster as an MP in May in the hope of being kingmaker, said the party that holds the balance of power 'holds the power'. The Conservatives are set to make the threat of a Labour/SNP government a major campaign issue in England. The party has already mocked up a poster showing a tiny Mr Miliband in Mr Salmond's pocket. And sources point out that the SNP has previously set out a string of ruinously high demands, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, increased immigration and billions more in benefits. Labour yesterday seized on Mr Salmond's admission that the SNP will back the party in government even if it cannot get a formal deal. Tom Harris, MP for Glasgow South, said Mr Salmond has 'dispensed with his last bargaining point'. 'They have nothing to offer us and they have no threats to make that are remotely realistic.' Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy described Mr Salmond as 'David Cameron's little helper'. In an interview with LBC radio, he conceded that the opinion polls are 'bloody awful for Labour'. A YouGov poll revealed that Miss Sturgeon is the most popular party leader. It gave her an approval rating of plus five.

Prior to the launch of Katy's official left shark merchandise line, a number of unofficial products have been made available by eager entrepreneurs hoping to cash in on the left shark's seemingly unwavering popularity. Last month, Katy's attorneys served an artist who was selling small figurines of the globally-famous dancing shark, who was played by professional dancer Bryan Gaw, online with a cease and desist letter, insisting that he remove the products from the website on which they were being sold. Prior to their warning, Fernando Sosa, 31, had been selling up to 15 of the $24.99 three-inch sharks, which were made using a 3D printer, per day via online marketplace Shapeways.com. Wardrobe update: As well as the onesie, Katy is also selling this left shark T-shirt for $25 . Shake your fin: Many fans watching the halftime performance felt that the sharks had stolen the show .

However, less than 36 hours after his statues became available, Shapeways officials  notified Mr Sosa of a cease-and-desist letter from Perry's Los Angeles-based attorneys who demanded the shark's removal from the site. 'They said they were pulling the design because they didn't want to deal with lawyers,' Mr Sosa said, adding that the company promptly cancelled his orders and refunded his customers. The letter from attorney Steve Plinio said Katy is the 'owner of the intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes' portrayed during the halftime show. The letter said the failure to comply with the demands outlined 'will be viewed by the courts as willful infringement'. Sosa said he didn't think a halftime show prop would be copyrighted.

The 18-year-old, who was only named by his surname Pratt in Chinese media, had travelled from his home state of Ohio across to Jiangshan, a city in Zhejiang province in China, after becoming infatuated with a young woman he had met online. But after getting the cold shoulder from his online ladylove when he turned up, he started drinking and was found suffering from hypothermia and unconscious on the staircase leading down into the Xu River. Scroll down for video . A lovesick American teenager (pictured) almost died after getting drunk and nearly drowning in a river when he was dumped by a young Chinese woman he flew 7000 miles to visit . The teen had met the girl online and promised that he would visit her. After getting the cold shoulder when he turned up, Pratt drank himself unconscious and was found on steps leading down into the Xu River . A spokesman from the Cheng Bei Police Station quoted on Qianjiang TV said: 'He was unconscious and lying in a pool of his own vomit. It looks as if he might have fallen in the water at some stage as his clothes and shoes were soaked. To be honest he was so inebriated, he could easily have drowned. It was only a short distance to the water.' Pratt was taken to a local hospital and after regaining consciousness discovered that he had also managed to lose all of his money meaning he could no longer pay for his hotel room. However after hearing about his hard luck story, the hotel manager decided to let the teenager have the room for free. He admitted to police that he did not know the girl's real name, only her online pseudonym which was Xiaoqian, and he also admitted he had only started talking to her this year. Because she had perfect English and great photographs, he had fallen head over heels in love and had promised to come and visit her. Homeward bound: The American teenager, known only as Pratt, survived his brush with death and is now returning to the United States according to the Chinese . Pratt is pictured here in hospital recovering from his ordeal . Police said it appears the young woman may not have taken him seriously until he suddenly turned up in Xiamen, in Fujian Province, and then went to Jiangshan to meet the girl. Detectives confirmed from his mobile phone that he did try to ring her several times, after which he was told to leave her alone – and his number was blocked. Depressed about the rejection, Pratt had started drinking and was last seen cursing and staggering near Xu River, where he was found passed out later that night. Police tracked the young woman down, but she again refused to meet him despite hearing about the fact that he had almost died. A police spokesman said: 'We followed his progress until he left the country, and he is already on the plane back to the United States.'

But the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel's hilarious comedy of errors is just the half of it, according to one couple who followed their dream of building a life in India. From monsoons to massive renovation bills, Britons Norman and Carole Steen have faced it all after exchanging the grey skies of Birmingham for the tropical paradise of Goa, where they took on a dilapidated building with hopes of turning it into their very own marigold hotel. Norman and Carole Steen, from Birmingham, moved to Goa to renovate a dilapidated building and set up their very own marigold hotel . If this sounds like the plot of the newly-released film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, that's because it is eerily similar - right down to the hurdles that the Steens had to overcome. Mr Steen, 61, said: 'We first started visiting India in the 1990s and it took us that long to get over the Delhi belly. 'Squid is still off the menu for us to this day. 'When we took over the property in 2005, it came with a whole host of problems. 'Every room needed a facelift from top to bottom. After purchasing the run-down building in 2005, the Steens have had to contend with a host of problems and continuous maintenance . 'There was no plumbing in it at all. 'There were only two lightbulbs in the house and no bathrooms. 'It cost around £15,000 for the structural work and this involved digging a metre-deep trench round the whole house. 'Every four years we need to inject chemicals into the walls and spray every bit of timber to make sure we don't get termites.' From termite infestations to monsoon damage, it cost around £15,000 to take on all the structural work and 14 months to complete . The experiences of the Steens sounds much like the plot of 2011's hit film, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Dev Patel . When the Steens, who are both retired lecturers, took over the property, they found the roof of the building was already home to a colony of long-tailed langur monkeys. Mr Steen said: 'The langurs running around on the roof, coupled with the four-month period of monsoons and high winds, meant the roofing tiles needed constant repairs. 'The last time we had our roof done, we had to buy 1,500 new tiles. 'It took 14 long months to complete the renovation of the property and it's one of those houses which constantly requires maintenance.' Mrs Steen, 60, said: 'Moving to India comes with frustrations. 'We arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate which is 700 years old, and it took a lot of fixing up. 'Even before we had even moved out there, we had to get through a whole host of paperwork to overcome the legalities of buying property and setting up a business in India. 'spent 10 years planning before we finally made the move.' The pair arrived with the intention of taking over a colonial estate, but at 700 years old, it required a lot of fixing up . The sequel to the 2011 film, called The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, brings back the original stars, such as Judi Dench . This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their beloved Casa Susegad is more successful than ever . This year, the Steens are celebrating ten years in India and their property, the Casa Susegad, is currently benefitting from a wave of renewed interest in India among UK retirees, largely due to the success of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel. Carole said: 'I am a huge fan of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. 'I took my mum to see it and told her it was a bit like my life out in India. 'I loved it. I can't wait to see the new film.' In fact, the property is currently benefitting from a renewed wave of interest thanks to the release of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel . Carole also added that she was very glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly British retirees . Carole said she was glad that India was becoming a more attractive holiday destination for elderly people. She said: 'While we love the country, just remember that it's very different to the UK.

From the Himalayan landscape to the ancient temples, I think we will be many lifetimes over before we get bored of this place. 'We have absolutely no regrets about moving over here to start our own exotic marigold hotel. It's definitely been worth it.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Norman and Carole Steen, from Birmingham, have set up a hotel in Goa as a retirement project .\nThe couple purchased the property in 2005 and inherited a whole host of problems including a family of monkeys .\nAfter countless repairs and £15,000 in renovations, the property is thriving 10 years on ."}]}

But while Aidan Turner was unknown to many prior to his turn as the troubled Ross Poldark in the BBC drama of the same name, the 31-year-old is no stranger to success. Yet although he may look familiar to some, others might find him hard to place - unless you're a fan of fantasy films and supernatural drama that is. Turner plays Ross Poldark who's lost his love, Elizabeth (played by Heida Reed, left) to another man . Irish actor Aidan Turner, who plays dashing Captain Ross Poldark, sets pulses racing on the BBC show . For before donning the tricorn hat and brooding scowl of the landowner who returns to Cornwall to find his true love is engaged to another man, Turner was busy fighting evil in Middle Earth. The 5ft 10in Turner was digitally shrunk for his role as Kili, one of two dwarf brothers who set out alongside Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins in a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. But with Martin Freeman playing Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage's brooding dwarf chieftan stealing all the screen thunder, you might have missed Aidan's fantastical role - had he not also enjoyed a plotline that involved flirting with Tauriel the elf, played by Evangeline Lilly. Action stations: From left, John Callen, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Adam Brown, Jed Brophy, Peter Hambleton, Ken Stott and Stephen Hunter in a scene from The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies film . He became famous as vampire John Mitchell in the BBC3 supernatural housemates dramedy Being Human . But it seems training to play the warrior dwarf may have helped sculpt the abs that have become famous in their own right. Turner told Empire about the prep needed for the trilogy: 'A lot of going to the gym; a lot of movement classes. Dwarves are just weighed down by everything,' he said. 'They’re not sluggish, they just have this work-horse mentality. When they get going they’re unstoppable.' Turner even popped up in The Tudors in one episode as a richly-dressed character called Bedoli . As John Schofield, Hattie Jacques' lodger and lover, Turner had to don Sixties clothing . Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman as brothers Kili and Fili respectively in a scene from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . Since graduating from The Gaiety School of Acting in 2004, the Dubliner has enjoyed an eclectic range of parts and notched up a number of award nominations. His career in television began in 2007 when he embraced 16th century-style costume to appear in one episode of the television series The Tudors. More period work was to follow when he was chosen to play pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics, followed swiftly by appearances as Ruairí McGowan on The Clinic. But Turner finally had a change of pace in 2008 when he was cast as the undead John Mitchell in the supernatural drama Being Human, about a werewolf, vampire and a ghost who share a house. With his hair slicked back, his face deathly pale, an all-black wardrobe and a set of menacing fangs, the actor earned a new army of fans.

Aidan Turner (second from right) dons period costume as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics alongside (from left) Samuel Barnett as John Millais, Sam Crane as Fred Walters and Rafe Spall as William Holman Hunt . But for Hattie, the 2011 TV film about   Hattie Jacques' life, Aidan returned to period costume again - this time from the Sixties - as the Carry On actress's lodger and lover, opposite Ruth Jones. Now that he's back in breeches for the BBC remake, Aidan is now appealing to a new class of Poldark fans. Not only are hoards of viewers tuning in to see him and learn of Poldark's adventures for the first time, fans from the original 1975 drama are also turning on their television sets to see how Aidan's portrayal of the charismatic hero differ. For the first time he may have become the stuff of female fantasy - rather than fantasy films.

Above, the Chancellor pictured ahead of the budget last year . Slashing £12billion from the nation’s bloated benefits bill will be at the heart of the Tory pitch for a second term in office. George Osborne’s pre-election budget next week will be a ‘steady as you go’ exercise with the emphasis on sustaining growth and reducing the deficit. But the Chancellor is planning to use a section of his speech – kept separate from measures agreed by the Coalition – to highlight proposals to ease the income tax burden. Tory sources say other measures that appear ‘nailed on’ for their election manifesto include: . The measures would help Mr Osborne find the £30billion he needs to erase the budget deficit by the end of the next Parliament in 2019. Treasury officials believe £5billion can be raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion on top of the £12billion annual welfare saving. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. The Tories say they will raise the point at which people pay higher rate income tax to £50,000 by the end of the next Parliament – lifting hundreds of thousands of middle class professionals out of the 40p band. Another objective is to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 a year. The Chancellor is also thought to be considering granting pensioners the right to take money out of their retirement funds. The move would be a radical extension of his decision last year to free retirees from having to buy what are often poor-value annuities with their pension savings. Although public borrowing for 2014-15 is expected to come at below the £91billion projected in the autumn statement last December, the Chancellor will have little wriggle room for electoral giveaways. His Liberal Democrat coalition partners are reluctant to allow him to use the Budget as a launch-pad for the Tory election campaign. However, another tax break for millions of workers is expected with a hike in the personal tax allowance, which is already due to rise to £10,600 next month. It is expected that the Chancellor will take the opportunity to announce a full review of the business rates system. Retailers have long been pushing for reform of rates – which have existed in various forms since Tudor times – to ease the pressure on the high street. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. Above, Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) Sources suggest that moving away from a charge based on the rateable value of a commercial property to a modern alternative – such as a sales tax – is one option. Critics of the existing system say that it is absurd in the internet age to base company taxes on the physical space they occupy. There is speculation that the Chancellor will use his budget to unveil populist measures such as a cut in the duty on beer and wine. Key tax avoidance and evasion measures to be announced by the Chancellor will include an end to ‘umbrella’ arrangements. One scheme – used by collapsed delivery firm City Link – allows companies to escape corporate and national insurance tax by employing their workforce as freelance sub-contractors. 'Google' tax: The HMRC will assess the British turnover of low tax paying companies such as Starbucks and Amazon and will tax them proportionally on the earnings in the UK. Above, file image . Mr Osborne is planning heavy penalties on tax advisers, including the big accounting firms, banks and others that set up and promote tax avoidance scams. Changes in the tax regime will make it unlawful for individuals or companies to raise new debts solely for the purpose of writing off the interest payments on that debt against tax. This technique is widely used by private equity firms. The budget will herald the final closure of the loopholes that allow companies and individuals to hide their tax affairs in secretive overseas jurisdictions. So far more than 90 countries – including Switzerland, Luxembourg and the British crown territories such as the Caymans – have signed up to a convention that requires them to be fully transparent and hand over the details of tax residents to HMRC.

The parents of five-year-old brain cancer sufferer Ashya King revealed today  their son is clear of the disease. Brett and Naghmeh King were put in prison after taking their son out of an NHS hospital and going across Europe to seek pioneering proton therapy in the Czech Republic. Now, some five months after he completed the pioneering treatment, they said Ashya was making good progress, starting to speak again and able to play with his brothers and sisters in the park. His parents told a newspaper he had been given the all-clear by the private clinic that treated him. Mr King, 51, told The Sun: 'We are absolutely delighted. It has justified everything we have gone through, because things are working out for Aysha. 'If we had left him with the NHS we don't think he would have survived. We have saved his life. 'We could not sleep before we got this news. Now we are so full of hope for the future. We are jumping up and down with joy this is a miracle we thought we would never see.' His wife, 46, added: 'We could not sleep before we got this news — now we are so full of hope for the future. We are jumping up and down with joy. It is a miracle we thought we would never see.' A report issued by the private clinic's oncology department last week declared Ashya cancer-free. However, the family has yet to return to the UK and are living in their holiday home in Spain. He described the advanced proton beam therapy treatment Ashya had as 'sniper fire' which specifically targeted the cancer. The couple sparked a manhunt last year when they took their son abroad to seek pioneering proton therapy. Mr King said the treatment was 'much less harmful' than the conventional therapy which doctors at Southampton General Hospital intended to give to Ashya. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. Scroll down for video . Fresh start: Five months after the pioneering proton therapy, Ashya, pictured in September in the Czech Republic, is making good progress, starting to speak again and able to play with his brothers and sisters . Support: Mr and Mrs King were arrested last year after taking their son out of an NHS hospital to take him for the pioneering treatment in the Czech Republic, pictured on the intensive ward  in Prague in September . But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Disappearance: The couple sparked a worldwide manhunt when they took Ashya from Southampton General Hospital last August (pictured  CCTV footage) Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. At the time, Mr King the family said they were so scarred by their nightmare experience that they would not be returning to the UK for the foreseeable future, fearing Ashya would be 'taken away' from them. Their son was largely left alone in a Spanish hospital during their three-day detention, howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family. Held in grimy adjoining cells at a Spanish police station, Mr King recalled to the Mail: 'She [Naghmeh] was crying: 'Ashya, where is my Ashya?' On and on and on . 'She was saying: 'Are you happy now? We should have stayed in England — this would never have happened.' Suddenly it was my fault.' Mrs King said: 'I wasn't crying for myself in prison, I was crying for Ashya. I didn't want him to be alone in a foreign country not understanding the language. I was just praying the nurses would feel sorry for him, be with him, so he wasn't completely alone.' Ashya had 30 irradiation sessions to fight his rare brain tumour at the Prague clinic which has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy because it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs. Good news: The Kings have stood by their decision and said that the treatment had been so successful that their son, pictured in October, had now been given the all-clear . Belief: Mrs King said that she believes that if she and her husband had left Ashya, pictured in September, at the NHS hospital, he would not have survived . Ashya was unable to speak or move following surgery in Britain and had still not uttered a word in the Prague clinic after the treatment. Mrs King told The Sun: 'At the clinic we were trying to get him to speak — then this nurse came in with a needle and he suddenly shouted 'No!'. 'We thought it was a miracle. It really blew our minds. He was just saying 'No' to everything. It was funny.' He soon progressed to other words — and now chatters away, according to the newspaper. The therapy is not available for him on the NHS, although the health service has since agreed to fund Ashya's treatment. The outcry over the family's ordeal led to criticism that police and prosecutors had been too cruel in issuing the European arrest warrant, which was eventually withdrawn. Public anger also prompted a nationwide fundraising effort in a bid to help the family. Dr Nick Plowman, senior clinical oncologist at Great Ormond Street children's hospital, told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'It's very gratifying to hear that he is in remission, and if time goes on and he holds that remission, hopefully that equates with cure. 'I do not agree that he could not have been in a similar situation had he had orthodox X-ray radiotherapy, which is going on to a very high standard in all the departments in this country. 'That's not to say there are no advantages of protons, but I think we could have achieved the remission he is in now with standard radiotherapy.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Brain cancer sufferer Ashya King given all clear after his proton therapy .\nHis parents sparked a manhunt last year when they took him from hospital .\nBrett and Naghmeh King took him for pioneering treatment in Prague .\nMr King said: 'This is a miracle we thought we would never see'\nThey were arrested and jailed in Spain but then released without charge .\nFive months on and the five-year-old is recovering well from the treatment .\nThe Kings claim if they had left their son with the NHS  he would have died ."}]}

Andrew Meikle, from estate agents Bletsoes, said this is a chance for people to own a picturesque piece of England 'as beautiful as anything in the Cotswolds', but for a fraction of the price. Sprawling: Green Farm estate features this seven bedroom Grade II listed farmhouse which is set in 600 acres of grounds and farmland . Hertiage: The estate has been passed down through the generations of the Rothschild family, and this is believed to be the first time it has come up for sale in 150 years . Bargain: For £8million the buyer will also get this three-acre wooded island situated in the River Nene which is accessible by weir (left) The estate was initially owned by the Rothschild family and is currently occupied by their descendants, having been passed down through generations. During the 19th century, when the family were believed to hold the largest private fortune in the world, they helped to remodel the village of Ashton for the workers they employed on the estate. The Grade II listed farmhouse is in a secluded location on the edge of the picturesque village. There are also two listed thatched cottages on the land - the three-bedroom West Lodge and one-bedroom Shepherdess Cottage. The farmland is spread out between Polebrook, Ashton and Oundle with 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland. The buyer would also get their own private island - three acres of woodland in the middle of the River Nene, which you can access by a weir. Mr Meikle said: 'As far as we know this is the first time the property has come on the open market in 150 years. It's a Rothschild property, it belongs to descendants of the family and has been handed down for generations. Huge: A satellite image showing the entire 600 acre estate. Number 1 shows the position of the main house, number 2 is the location of Shepherdess Cottage, number three marks West Lodge, and number 4 is the island in the River Nene. Inset top left and bottom right are two plots of land that are also included. Top right in the position of all three portions of the estate to scale . Beautiful: The price tag includes two listed cottages located within the grounds, including this three-bedroom property named West Lodge . Quaint: Tucked away in another corner of the huge estate is this one-bedroom thatched property named Shepherdess Cottage . Vast: Among the 600 acres that come with the houses are 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland . 'We're very open-minded about how it might sell. There are a number of properties, lots of land and it's even got an island. It's the perfect opportunity for someone to buy a bit of England. 'It's in Northamptonshire, a really picturesque, forgotten part of the country - it's as nice as places in the Cotswolds but for quarter the price. 'A local farmer who came to look at it said he can't remember anything of this size being available in the last 20 years. 'It's got some great commercial land, a lovely frontage on the river, meadows, woodlands and development potential. There's pasture land that could be used for traditional livestock, or might appeal to the equine market as well. It's got absolutely loads of potential. 'The island is three acres of mature woodland and sits in the middle of the River Nene. You cross to the island by weir.

Rona Fairhead admitted there is a problem with ‘blurred accountabilities’ between corporation bosses and the BBC Trust she heads, and that it is time for proper outside oversight. Her comments echo MPs’ claims that the trust is ‘too close to the BBC and blurs accountability… rather than it being a sharp and effective overseer’. Rona Fairhead (pictured) admitted there is a problem with ‘blurred accountabilities’ between corporation bosses and the BBC Trust she heads, and that it is time for proper outside oversight . A report by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new Public Service Broadcasting Commission, which would regulate the BBC’s spending and strategy. Mrs Fairhead did not agree with all of the committee’s recommendations, but said the Trust should be replaced with a rigorous external regulator whose sole purpose would be to hold the BBC to account. She also called for the BBC to have a stronger board, with more non-executive directors and an independent chairman to help keep the corporation on track and prevent problems that might need regulatory intervention. ‘Responsibilities for strategy, financial and operational management need to sit with the BBC executive to allow them to respond to a rapidly changing environment,’ she said. ‘Responsibilities for regulation and broader accountability need to sit at one remove. A report by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new Public Service Broadcasting Commission, which would regulate the BBC’s spending and strategy . ‘That way, there should be no possibility of vagueness or uncertainty about who will be held responsible for what when the chips are down.’ She added the ‘cleanest form of separation’ would be to transfer the BBC Trust’s responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external regulator. ‘That’s an approach we want to explore further. I think it’s the front-runner,’ she said. Mrs Fairhead made her speech at a media conference in Oxford, where many were surprised at her apparent willingness to get rid of the body she runs. However, others were wary about her links to HSBC. Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs . Mrs Fairhead, 53, has spent more than a decade as a director of the embattled bank, which is facing allegations that it helped wealthy clients evade tax. Last year, she was paid more than £500,000 for 50 days’ work there. She and the rest of the bank’s directors say they had no knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing. The former Pearson executive, who is also on the board of PepsiCo, will be grilled about her role at HSBC by the Public Accounts Committee on Monday. Mrs Fairhead said yesterday she was ready to be questioned and that her role as chairman of the BBC Trust was her priority. ‘I was very clear when I took this role that the BBC was my priority and that I would keep under review my positions on the HSBC and PepsiCo boards,’ she said. Mrs Fairhead’s predecessor, Lord Patten, was accused of ‘taking his eye off the ball’ during his tenure after it emerged he was doing ten other jobs alongside his £110,000-a-year position at the BBC Trust. The former Tory Cabinet minister had five paid posts and five voluntary posts, helping him to earn an extra £200,000 a year.

Sunita Day, 45, who once dated Sir Terence Conran, was disinherited by her gambling-addict mother Pamela Russell. But a judge ruled yesterday that she was entitled to keep an £800,000 flat she had been given in 1995. Sunita Day, 45, (left) was disinherited by her mother Pamela Russell before her death in 2013 and everything was left to her brother Rajan Russell (right) The court heard that restaurateur Mrs Russell, who died in 2013, underwent a personality change after being diagnosed with cancer. She frittered away much of her fortune in casinos and turned against her daughter. Mrs Russell left her entire estate to Mrs Day’s older brother, investment banker Rajan Russell. He maintained the estate included his sister’s flat in Battersea, South West London. Mrs Day, who made headlines when she was in her 20s for ‘stepping out’ with designer Sir Terence, 38 years her senior, said the flat had been a gift to get her on the property ladder. Before her illness her mother, to whom she had been very close, often showered her with presents, she told Central London County Court. ‘She was always buying me things like mink coats and jewellery – you name it I had it,’ Mrs Day said. ‘I was spoilt... the flat just followed.’ But she said her mother’s gambling addiction turned her into ‘a harridan with a capital H’ and at one point she feared Mrs Russell would have her ‘bumped off’ to get the flat back. Her mother had given her a luxury £800,000 flat in Battersea, south London (pictured) 20 years ago but Mr Russell claimed it was part of his mother's estate . During her final years, her mother had visited casinos every night and even resorted to stealing gambling chips, Mrs Day claimed. She said she lived in fear of her multi-millionaire brother, whom she called ‘bully boy Raj’, and that he was jealous of anything their mother gave her. Mr Russell, 47, denied his sister’s claims. But after a four-day hearing, Judge Marc Dight ruled that Mrs Day was entitled to keep the flat, which had been ‘freely gifted’. He rejected Mr Russell’s claim that she merely held the flat as a trustee and ruled he was entitled to only a £55,000 stake in the property to reflect a mortgage paid off by his mother. Judge Dight also ordered Mr Russell to pay most of his sister’s six-figure legal bill. However he rejected Mrs Day’s claims that she had been put under ‘duress or undue influence’ by her brother and mother. He said Mrs Russell’s personality had changed after her cancer diagnosis in March 2010. In a document she wrote in May 2012 explaining why she had disinherited her daughter, she claimed Mrs Day ‘never came to see me while I had breast cancer and has been very disagreeable all her life since the age of 14. I feel like I have done three life sentences with Sunita’. The judge said: ‘By the end of her life, and certainly from the time she was diagnosed with cancer, Mrs Russell had a deep-rooted and unhealthy gambling habit. ‘She was very unwell. The evidence satisfies me that she was unkind to those around her, including Mrs Day. She was manipulative with her relatives and many of her friends.’ Judge Dight said Mrs Russell had tried to pressure and manipulate her daughter into giving her back the flat but Mrs Day had a ‘feisty’ determination to hold on to the property. Mrs Day (right, outside court this week) 'stepped out' with Sir Terence Conran (left) when she was in her 20s and previously gave an interview to a magazine which 'dealt' with their relationship ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sunita Day, 45, was disinherited by her mother Pamela Russell in her will .\nWhen she died in 2013 everything was left to her brother Rajan Russell .\nInterior designer held onto an £800,000 flat in south London from mother .\nBanker brother claimed it was part of mother's estate and should be his .\nMrs Russell had 'extreme gambling habit' and went to casinos every day .\nJudge Marc Dight ruled flat was freely gifted to Mrs Day and hers to keep ."}]}

But while Sam Piccini, of Rochester, says that gun clubs from all over are 'chomping at the bit' for their pay-as-you-go dispensaries, complaints about the machines and their safety seem just as widespread. Piccini has installed two at his local gun club, the Beaver Valley Rifle and Pistol Club, which, like many, refuses to sell 'non-jacketed' rounds of ammunition, making the machines popular among members. Controversial: An ammunition salesman and former cop has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in Rochester, Pennsylvania . 'It's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition': Former cop Sam Piccini says the machines are perfectly legal and that he created them for the convenience of gun club members only . The machines are kept behind locked doors that require a digital key fob - which all members have -to open. The swipe cards grant 24-hour access to the club's grounds shooting ranges, where the ammunition vending machine is located. All members have to be over 18 to get a swipe card. In Pennsylvania, people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition, and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns. Piccini has defended himself against cries that the devices will allow minors easy access to ammo. 'It's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition,' he told Fox News. The machines sell nearly every caliber of bullet from .22 to .45. 'The machine sells pretty much everything,' said Piccinini, . 'From .22 long rifle to .45 Long Colt and every standard caliber in between except .32 and .25 automatic. 'It's got 380, 9, 38, 40, 45, .357 SIG. I manufacture all of it myself.' They keys are given to members 18 years and over, meaning people under 21 could possible purchase handgun bullets they are not legally entitled to. However local newspaper The Beaver Countian report receiving 'several tips' from locals raising concerns about the machines. Not candy: This vending machine - operated by Sam Piccini, a candidate for Beaver County Sheriff - which distributes firearms ammunition is raising some eyebrows . A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - which regulates the sale of ammunition - confirmed to the newspaper the machines could provide bullets to minors. 'I don't want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation, but a licensee can not sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18, and importantly you can not sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21,' ATF Special Agent Stephen Bartholomew told the paper. Piccini said he had the idea years ago, and spent time modifying the machines so they could accept larger bills and credit cards, with the price of bullets much higher than that of candy. Piccini, who is a current candidate for Beaver County Sheriff, said he consulted lawyers about the machines and maintains that operating them is perfectly legal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sam Piccini retired from the force after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business .\nHe has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in Rochester, Pennsylvania, that sell 'everything'\nThey can only be accessed by members, who must be the age of 18 .\nLocal press say residents are concerned about the safety of the machines ."}]}

But few of those children go from dodging their homework and playing hopscotch in lunch break to ruling the country. Gordon Brown has now shared the school photo that he had taken aged five when he was a pupil at Kirkcaldy West Primary School. Gordon and Sarah Brown shared their old school pictures as part of social media campaign called #UpForSchool by the initiative A World At School, which Sarah co-founded. (Pictured left: Gordon Brown, aged five, pictured right: Sarah Brown, aged 11) The former PM shared the snap as part of a social media campaign organised by his wife Sarah Brown, to push for better education for girls in the developing and third world. Sarah, who runs the charity Theirworld and is the co-founder of the initiative A World At School, also shared her old school photo on Twitter with the hashtag #UpForSchool. The aim of the campaign is to attract signatures for the initiative's upforschool.org petition, which will be delivered to world leaders in September to ensure they keep a promise they made in 2000 to get every girl and boy into school and learning by the end of 2015. The petition has already attracted three million signatures on their site. The actress and comedian Miranda Hart has also shared a picture of herself as a child with the words: 'My old school photo (hot) to support International Women's Day and #UpForSchool.' Miranda Hart as a school child left, and at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in London, in June 2013, right . TOWIE star Lydia Bright's (right) mother Debbie also posted a picture of her daughter at school (left) The petition reads: 'Every child has the right to go to school, without danger or discrimination. 'Help create a message no government, politician or leader can ignore and demand that every child can go to school safely. Nothing changes without pressure. 'We are standing up to bring an end to the barriers preventing girls and boys from going to school, including forced work and early marriage, conflict and attacks on schools, exploitation and discrimination. 'All children deserve the opportunity to learn and achieve their potential.' Education of girls not only further their independence, it also cuts the rate of child deaths, teen pregnancy and helps to provide more stable families. Illiteracy among women contributes to greater numbers of preventable child deaths. A child born to literate mother is 50 per cent more likely to survive past the age of five than a child born to an illiterate mother. Left: Gordon Brown speaks at Dumbarton Town hall to No campaigners last September in Glasgow, right: Sarah Brown at a 'Girl Rising' Screening at BAFTA in April 2013 . Education also has a great impact on sexual and reproductive health outcomes for girls and women. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the birth rate among girls with no education is over 4x higher than those with secondary education. Providing education for girls also helps to fuel economic growth of a country. An educated female population increases a country's productivity, yet some countries lose more than £650 million  a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. For example, if all girls in Kenya completed primary education, their additional output would equal 20 per cent of Kenya’s GDP. If all adolescent girls completed secondary education and delayed pregnancy until their twenties, this would add £2 billion to the Kenyan economy every year.

Gay rights activist Rodney Croome said: 'Peter Abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths and prejudices that the Safe Schools Program is designed to challenge' A former Christian pastor and politician described an anti-bullying campaign as a 'gay lifestyle promotion program', in remarks blasted by gay rights activists. Peter Abetz, a WA state government backbencher - who first spoke to The West Australian - said he was concerned the Safe Schools Coalition Australia program would elevate LGBTI children to 'celebrity' status. 'I don't believe that any program should go into a school which actually elevates a subset of students - LGBTI - to celebrity status and gives them special privileges which are not afforded to any other sub-group in the school,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Abetz said 'no one' should have to tolerate bullying but campaigns targeting gay, lesbian and transgender students could lead to more bullying in schools overall. He said being gay was 'not normal' - as heterosexuals make up '90 to 95 per cent of the population on a 'distribution curve' and just as 'skinny' or 'obese' people are not the majority. 'Just because it's not the norm in the population doesn't mean they shouldn't be respected and treated with dignity,' he said. Prominent gay rights advocate and Tasmanian of the Year Rodney Croome  blasted Mr Abetz's remarks.

This poster here is among several downloadable from the Safe Schools Coalition Australia's website .

'The research also shows that one of the best ways to address this risk is to give teachers the skills and information they need to effectively challenge classroom prejudice and bullying.' The Safe Schools Coalition Australia program, which received a four-year, $8m grant from the Federal government, supports 'gender diversity, intersex and sexual diversity' in Australian schools. The program will be implemented in Western Australia from the middle of this year. Sally Richardson, the program's national director, said in a statement: 'Since the program's official launch last June we have had a lot of interest and support from WA schools, young people and community organisations.

But one patriotic bagpiper is taking Scottish heritage around the world as he aims to be the first Scot to play the instrument in every single country. Ross O'Connell Jennings, 25, has played in a total of 34 countries and is working his way around the world to bring Scottish music to the masses. Scroll down for video . 25-year-old Ross O'Connell Jennings is attempting to be the first person to play the bagpipes in every country. The half Scot, half Irishman said his friends thought he was initially ridiculous but are now extremely supportive . A musical fan! At the Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, Ross played for the giraffes to the delight of the creatures, who started marching in a line in time . Ross has so far played at 34 countries, including France, and hopes to complete them all in his lifetime. He usually gets a very receptive welcome when playing abroad, but has had a few close shaves being stopped by Tunisian guards and by Vatican police . Fitting in! Ross says he gets a mixed reaction to the kilt, mostly positive. Here pictured at Doraemonin Tokyo in Japan . The motivational speaker is no stranger to travel, having attended an international school in Shanghai, lived in Thailand for a while, and studied Economics and Chinese at Edinburgh University. His father would always encourage him to take his bagpipes wherever he travelled, and Ross realised that he had racked up an impressive number of countries that he had played in. 'When I told my friends and family that I was going to try and attempt to do every country they thought I was absolutely ridiculous, but are incredibly supportive,' the half Scot, half Irishman said. Ross prefers to travel by himself, as he says it is more fun because he meets a lot of people who are curious about his mission and the kilt. When he was recently in Jerusalem, a girl grabbed him as soon as she spotted his Scottish attire, and insisted that he play on the top of the Tower of David. The bagpipes have also proven to be a way to get out of some sticky situations. When travelling in Tunisia, a police guard stopped his rented car and grilled him on why it was not registered. Having done prior research Ross knew that the bagpipe was similar to the Tunisian mezoued, and ended up playing for them, to their delight, and was allowed on his way. Bit chilly?! Ross has even taken his bagpipes and kilt on the slopes in Canada in a bid to complete his round the world mission . Ross uses the name, The First Piper, on social media accounts, and fans can track his mission on facebook and instagram. Here pictured in Shanghai . Animal audience: Ross has played for a number of creatures along the way. These warthogs in Nairobi appear to be unperturbed by the instrument . Transporting the instrument is one of the hardest part of mission, the bagpiper revealed. As they have to be taken on planes as hand luggage, there are always confused reactions when it goes through the x-ray machine. 'I nearly always get pulled over and asked whether it is a shisha pipe, or a weapon!' he said. When Ross reaches a country they are usually very receptive to his playing. The Vatican police were less than impressed, however, and he was almost immediately accosted by officers. 'They quickly silenced me, but admitted they thought it was kind of cool,' Ross said. Animals similarly seem to appreciate the bagpipe playing, and the adventurer has counted giraffes, goats, dogs and cats among his audience. 'When I was in Nairobi at the Giraffe Manor they were initially hesitant as to how the giraffes would react to the sound,' he said. 'I began playing and they actually starting marching in line, it was incredible.' 'There have been mixed reactions to the kilt though,' Ross admitted. At the foot of Kilimanjaro he encountered a group of ladies who were in hysterics at his attire and playing, one of the older ladies even went as far as to call his kilt 'disgusting.' It emerged that she had last heard the bagpipes before her husband went to fight in World War 2. 'It is amazing how the music can bring people together, all over the world,' he said. 'This is something that I am trying to do on my travels, even in a small way.' England . Ireland . Scotland . Wales . Denmark . France . Spain . Monaco . Latvia . San Marino . Vatican City . Italy . Portugal . Switzerland . Germany . Tunisia . Malaysia . Kenya . Uganda . Tanzania . Rwanda . South Africa . Israel . Canada . British Virgin Islands . Cayman Islands . Cuba . China . Mongolia . Taiwan . South Korea . Japan . Thailand . Singapore . When he is not travelling, Ross works in England for a company that runs seminars and motivational speeches in secondary schools. 'Work have been absolutely phenomenal about what I'm doing,' Ross said. 'I tend to get holidays when the school holidays fall, which is great for my travelling.' The musician saves from his job, and has been helped out by generous contacts he has made, and even the Scottish Saltire Society and Smart Turnout menswear have contributed to his mission. Although he does not tend to busk in the countries when he is playing, some people insist on paying for his performance. Japan was where he received the most donations, and he had no sooner opened his bagpipe case to take out his instrument when people were already throwing coins into his box and taking photographs. Ross' next mission is for Ethiopia in April and his travels can be followed on facebook or instagram. When in Rome: Ross does not just want to travel and see what he can get from a destination, but aims to give back to where he visits, and share  his love for music with them . On the go! Ross has travelled to Wenzhou in China in full outfit. The talented Scot is fluent in Mandarin, and even studied Economics and Chinese at university . Sunrise at Lake Bunyonyi in Uganda, allegedly the second deepest lake in Africa. Usually bagpipes cost between £500-£5000, and you can even get gold or silver ones. Ross' cost £1000 .

This is what the Simoneau family found out when they spotted two giant earthworms near their Buderim home on the Sunshine Coast. ‘At first glance we thought they were snakes. It was just this dark long object on a pale tile,’ Tamara Simoneau told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Seven-year-old Scarlett Simoneau holds up the giant earthworm that was found at her house in Buderim . ‘It was a scare because at first they looked like snakes. But after a closer look the snakes turned out to be giant earthworms. The two worms measured between 60cm and a metre long.’ The heavy rain that hit Queensland when Cyclone Marsha passed by was what brought the giant earthworms to the surface. Earthworms are uncomfortable when the ground is very saturated and they were probably looking for higher ground during bad weather. It's this big: Scarlett lays the giant earthworm on the floor to show how long it is . ‘They were massive. The ones I’m used to seeing are more like spaghetti. There was one in the garage that was crawling slowly along the concrete, while the other one appeared a few days later on a mat on our patio,’ Tamara said. Tamara had lived in Canada for eight years, so she when she put pictures of the giant earthworms on Facebook her Canadian friends could not believe it. ‘The best comment was: ‘In Canada we call that a snake.’ They were all pretty shocked. A few others said they were going to come and visit me after seeing this,’ she said. Scarlett was fascinated by the huge earthworm and couldn't wait to pick it up . ‘But even my Australian friends were pretty surprised at the size of them.’ Tamara’s seven-year-old daughter Scarlett was fascinated by the worms, and couldn’t wait to pick them up and inspect them. ‘She put on a gardening glove and picked it up. She was very gentle when she picked it up. Then it expanded and got even longer. We put it in the garden and watched it make its way slowly back underground,’ she said.

The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation . ‘Goodbye Wayne … good riddance,’ tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: ‘My feelings are that he’s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he’s cheating, good riddance.’ Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: ‘Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.’ Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain’s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray’s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman’s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells . 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources. The fact that Odesnik was initially caught this time in December shows the value of more expensive out-of-competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments, where it is most expected."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American tennis player Wayne Odesnik handed a 15-year ban .\nThe 29-year-old tested positive for a number of banned substances .\nSuspension will last until January 29, 2030 .\nAndy Murray and Andy Roddick voice approval over the ban ."}]}

Edward Martin was sent the enormous invoice after the mobile phone company put him on a new tariff, but after eight hours on the phone he was unable to get them to admit their mistake. Eventually, he was forced to go and camp outside the multinational firm's headquarters - and they were so desperate to make him go away that they caved in and cancelled the bill. Victory: Edward Martin managed to get a £15,000 phone bill cancelled by protesting at Vodafone's head office . Mr Martin, 52, who runs a clothing business in Tiverton, Devon, said that his troubles started when he was put on a new package and told his bill would be recalculated. Vodafone then sent him a series of inflated bills adding up to £14,949.41 - without explaining why he suddenly had to pay more. 'I have been a Vodafone customer for 21 years with no trouble,' he said. 'But in December they called me to say they had made a mistake and they would recalculate my bill. 'But they never called me back and never let me know in writing what my new tariff was. All they want is for me to pay up but I'm not going to because they have made a mistake, not me. 'I haven't used any more text or data than I did before I went into the Exeter store to get a new deal. I really don't understand what has changed.' Proactive: Mr Martin had been unable to resolve the situation by phoning customer services . He repeatedly tried to phone the company to discuss the error, but was unable to rectify the situation. 'I must have spent eight hours on the phone to them being transferred to India, then Johannesburg, then onto Egypt and back to South Africa,' Mr Martin said. 'On one occasion I waited 27 minutes to speak with someone who told me they would call me back but they never did. That's just basic disregard for their customers.' The businessman finally decided to take drastic action, and yesterday he drove two hours from his home to the firm's head office in Newbury, Berkshire. Staff there initially said it would take three days to resolve the problem - but when Mr Martin refused to leave the premises, they dealt with his issue immediately. HQ: Vodafone's global headquarters are situated in Newbury, Berkshire, two hours from Mr Martin's home . He said: 'All seven car parks were full so I parked at the very front of the building, ignoring protestations from the security guys, and marched into reception.

'The techie guy I spoke to made calls to various teams and one hour later appeared to tell me it would be sorted on Friday. 'I said this was unacceptable and I feared they were just giving me the run-around like they've been doing for the past four months. 'I thought nothing would be resolved by Friday so I told him I would wait there until then. He told me I could not do that so I sat firmly on a chair and told him to call security. 'He disappeared to the office and one hour later the headquarters store assistant manager appeared and told me that the whole bill would be cleared immediately. 'About 15 minutes later I was on my way with a letter confirming that my overcharge had been cleared and a copy of my correct contract.

The Ivory Coast midfielder has two-and-a-half years left on his deal but City are open to extending his contract, which is worth £220,000 a week, and are set to tempt him with a prestigious job behind the scenes. At the age of 31, this is likely to be Toure’s final big-money contract. Manchester City are ready to offer Yaya Toure a role as a club ambassador when he retires from playing . The Ivorian midfielder has two and a half years left on his deal but City are open to extending his contract . At the age of 31, this is likely to be former Barcelona midfielder Toure’s final big-money contract . But Financial Fair Play rules are an issue and City would be reluctant to offer him a pay increase. Instead, they are exploring other incentives, with an ambassadorial role or even a coaching position being talked about. It is a far cry from last summer when Toure threatened to leave after being angered that the club did not acknowledge his birthday sufficiently. But while it seems Toure could end his career in Manchester, defender Bacary Sagna is growing agitated at his bit-part role and may consider his future at the end of the season. Roma coach Rudi Garcia is understood to be monitoring the 32-year-old’s situation with a view to a summer switch. Sagna signed a three-year deal upon arriving from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer. Bacary Sagna has failed to hold down a first-team place and is growing frustrated at his bit-part role . The France defender has started just 12 games for Manchester City so far this season . Roma boss Rudi Garcia is understood to have taken an interest in Sagna's position at Manchester City . But he has made only 12 starts while failing to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta as the club’s first-choice right back. That lack of action is frustrating the France defender, who was a regular at the Emirates. Sources close to the player say he is keen to help City challenge for the Premier League and Champions League. But if his first-team chances don’t improve, Sagna may look elsewhere for regular football. City, however, are in a position of strength as Sagna will have two years left on his contract this summer. Meanwhile, New York City head coach Jason Kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding Frank Lampard’s delayed move from City. He said: ‘This means some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities in his position.

A struggling university is paying up to £100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at a luxury hotel. The breaks in the Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton so its controversial vice-chancellor can give pep talks. Professor George Holmes, who was recently lent almost £1million by the university so he could move house, owns a private yacht which is moored less than ten miles from the hotel. The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about £220 a night for a room with a view of the lake. The university says the one-night ‘working residential’ trips, for which it pays all the travel, food and accommodation costs, are an ‘informative’ and ‘valuable’ way to discuss strategic aims. It has organised 20 breaks as part of its staff development programme. The first was in September and the last will be in May. Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour whose yacht is moored at a marina on Windermere, addresses each group ‘engaging directly in dialogue in respect of the strategy’. The university, which in 2013 was ranked worst in the country in two guides, said feedback from employees had so far been positive. But according to Times Higher Education, a source at the university said staff were ‘amazed’ by the scheme because it ‘must cost a fortune’. A university spokesman said it ‘considers this an appropriate developmental investment in staff to underpin the growing strength of the university’. The spokesman said it was part of a multi-million-pound investment in teaching and learning infrastructure, adding: ‘For the avoidance of doubt, the yacht belongs to the vice-chancellor personally and is operated, maintained and moored at the vice-chancellor’s own expense. ‘The yacht is not university property and has no relevance to the university’s current staff development programme taking place at the Lakeside Hotel.’ The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about £220 a night for a room with a view of the lake . Last month, it was revealed that the University of Bolton gave Professor Holmes a two-year £960,000 loan to buy a house nearer the campus without him having to sell his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The move was to save him a 100-mile round-trip, allowing the 53-year-old, who took up his post in 2006, to ‘play a greater role’ in the university and the town. Professor Holmes, who in 2013 was paid a £47,200 bonus on top of his £198,200 salary, bought an imposing Edwardian detached house, described by estate agents as a sublime example of the Arts and Crafts movement. It is understood the £920,000 property acts as both his personal home and a space to host VIP dinners and events connected with the university. The loan, at a 3.25 per cent interest rate, is due to be paid back once the Wakefield home is sold."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The breaks in Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton .\nTrip is arranged so staff can hear pep talk from Professor George Holmes .\nVice-chancellor owns a yacht moored less than ten miles from the hotel .\nHe was recently lent nearly £1million by university so he could move house .\nUniversity describes breaks as 'an appropriate developmental investment'"}]}

The 25-year-old, who regularly represented his country at Under 17 and Under 19 levels, has been included in a provisional 35-man party for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on March 29. Manager Martin O'Neill will reduce the initial squad before the players meet up on March 22 ahead of what could prove to be a key game in the qualification campaign, but there could yet be a place for a surprise inclusion in the shape of Arter. Harry Arter (left) has been called up to the Ireland squad after impressing for Bournemouth this season . David Forde (Millwall), Shay Given (Aston Villa), Keiren Westwood (Sheffield Wednesday) Darren Randolph (Birmingham), Rob Elliot (Newcastle), Richard Keogh (Derby), Marc Wilson (Stoke), Seamus Coleman (Everton), Cyrus Christie (Derby), John O'Shea (Sunderland), Alex Pearce (Reading), Paul McShane (Hull), James McCarthy (Everton), Jeff Hendrick (Derby), Ciaran Clark (Aston Villa), Stephen Ward (Burnley .

O'Neill said: 'He is having a very good season. I think, yeah, why not? It would be nice to have a look at him. 'He's obviously played at under-age level and I wanted to introduce another fresh face. There are no guarantees of anything. I've met him twice now and I think he deserves that chance. 'This might be a surprise to him as I didn't say anything to him. He will hopefully be pleasantly surprised.' Former Charlton trainee Arter is currently in his fifth season with the Cherries after joining them from Woking in June 2010, and has scored six goals in 38 appearances to date during the current campaign. Bournemouth head into the weekend having returned to the top of the Sky Bet Championship table as a result of their 5-1 victory at Fulham last weekend, but only on goal difference with Derby, Watford and Middlesbrough all level with them on 66 points and Norwich just a point behind. Hull midfielder Robbie Brady and Everton counterpart Aiden McGeady have been included, although Brady in particular is struggling with a torn calf muscle, while former Celtic winger McGeady is nursing a bruised knee. Arter has been the driving force behind Bournemouth's quest for promotion to the Premier League . But there was no place for Aston Villa's Jack Grealish, who is yet to make up his mind over whether to opt for Ireland or England, a process which has been ongoing for some time to the particular frustration of O'Neill's assistant and former Villa number two Roy Keane. The Poland game could prove crucial to the Republic's hopes of making it to the finals in the wake of November's 1-0 Group D defeat in Scotland. O'Neill's men opened their campaign with victories in Georgia and at home to Gibraltar, and a 1-1 draw in Germany in October boosted their hopes of claiming second spot with the reigning world champions expected to recover from a less-than-impressive start by their lofty standards. However Poland, who were expected to rival the Irish and the Scots for the runners-up spot, currently enjoy a three-point lead over Germany, Scotland and Ireland at the top of the table having beaten the Germans 2-0 in Warsaw during October, only to be held to a 2-2 draw by Gordon Strachan's men three days later. O'Neill said: 'Poland are a very strong team, they've obviously got off to a great start. Confidence is obviously very high there. They look up to the task.

The grieving family of teenager Conner Marshall, 18, who died following a brutal assault at a seaside caravan park have paid tribute to a 'unique and caring' son. A man from the South Wales area was arrested in Scotland yesterday after  Conner, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, died following the assault at Treco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl. Conner was found with multiple injuries in the early hours of Sunday March 8 but tragically died six days later at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

But if the thought of a Crème Egg Burger has your tastebuds recoiling at the horror of a meat patty slathered in crème egg filling, relax - this burger is made entirely from confectionery. And this Frankenstein food - created specially for Easter by chefs in the Studio Kitchen burger lab, K West Hotel & Spa in Shepherds Bush, West London - will be available throughout spring. Scroll down for video . The Crème Egg Burger is more sweet treat than meat feast, with chocolate covered brioche buns, a melted chocolate Crème Egg 'patty', plus strawberry jam filling and lashings of mascarpone cream . Sure to send sugar levels soaring, the mini slider burgers see a gooey melted crème egg playing the part of the patty, slathered in 'ketchup' made from strawberry jelly and sitting on a bed of thickly spread mascarpone cream. Then of course, there are the buns. Slices of sweet brioche, the top layer is dunked in melted white chocolate for a thorough coating, before being sprinkled with colourful hundreds and thousands. More sweet treat that meaty feast, the burgers have gone straight to the top of the Studio Kitchen dessert menu, priced at £5.50 for a portion of two. Served from the end of March 2015 and throughout spring in celebration of Easter, the burgers also appear in the hotel's decadent Spring Rocks Afternoon Tea. The Easter creation follows public outrage over the change in chocolate recipe for classic Cadbury's Crème Eggs. Changes to the classic Dairy Milk chocolate recipe used in Cadbury Crème Eggs sparked public outrage in January, as shoppers were told a sweeter 'standard cocoa mix chocolate' would be used instead this year . A spokesperson for Cadbury, bought by American giant Kraft in 2010, revealed back in January that the nation's favourite chocolate egg will no longer be coated in Dairy Milk. An official announcement stated, 'It’s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk.' Chefs at the Studio Kitchen aren't the first to turn Britain's best-loved Easter treat into a new concoction.

In the show Benefits Britain, which airs on Channel 5 tonight, a camera crews follows Debbie Merton, 46, who hasn't worked in 24 years and lives in a large council flat on the East Sussex coast. She doesn't reveal the disability  that allows her to receive this amount of money every month, but says that it is unlikely she will ever be able to get a job. Scroll down for video . Debbie Merton, who gets a benefits income of just under £1,100 a month and hasn't work in 24 years . While Debbie has been on state handouts for several years, she reveals that as a young woman, she also struggled to find any work because of her lack of skills. She said: 'I tried getting other jobs before I was disabled but couldn't because I had no qualifications, it really winds me up - I get so angry.' She continued: 'It's bloody hard and the government  don't really give a s***, they're alright in their posh houses and eating lobster and caviar every night.' 'It's just disgusting how they expect you to live on money and support a house and support yourself.' Debbie, centre, with her partner Pete, right and their friends, left, at one of Debbie's regular dinner parties . Another person who hits the sharp side of Debbie's tongue is the Queen. As Debbie has her neighbours round for dinner and several drinks, she holds court on the British monarch, saying: 'Look at the Queen, she's got Buckingham Palace and God knows how many other f****** properties. 'All her grandchildren and kids have got two, three, four different houses and we're sitting here on the poverty line, eating c**p. while THAT is sitting in her f****** palace, eating pretty, eating swan and everything. 'It winds me up.' Debbie is known for being a socialite in the area and loves having friends over for home-cooked meals and a knees-up. Debbie with one of her pets - a bearded dragon . But her outgoing nature eventually gets the better of her and after one raucous evening too many, she receives a formal warning from her local housing association over loud noise coming from her flat. According to the official letter, her neighbours have complained about fights in her home and loud music being played until the early hours, leading to the police having to be called at 2am. She says: 'We did have a discussion earlier in the evening, but when the police turned up at two in the morning, we were ready for our bed.' 'We're meant to be a community at the end of the day but now I've got a final warning to get out of my flat. 'I'm definitely moving from here, I can't stand it round here. 'If the council don't help me move, I'm prepared to go and live on the street.' Stacey Farrand, 28, from Hastings, who gets just £56 a week to support herself and her baby Eddie . Another person on the show is single mother Stacey Farrand, 28, from Hastings, who lives in a one-room bedsit with her son Eddie and lives off £56 a week. Stacey is trying her best to move out of her 15 sq ft room and into a two-bedroom house, but can't afford the £800 deposit needed for a new flat. She was employed for several years full-time as a builder until she fell pregnant and she frequently explains to the cameras that she can't wait until she is off benefits again and in employment so that she can give her son the things he needs. She says: 'I'd love to not be on benefits and go back to work. 'If I had the money now, no limited money, I'd get a flat, get Eddie a decent bed, do his bedroom up and then save up to do my driving lessons. 'I need him to have a bed, a room and a bath - he hasn't even experienced a bath yet, only a sink. 'I'm meant to provide for him. 'I want a benefit-free, stress-free life for Eddie, I don't want him to worry about having dinner, where he's going to sleep or whether he's going to have a sheet on his bed. 'This time next year, hopefully we won't be on any benefits and we'll be in a two bedroom flat.' Stacey buys her shopping from the out-of-date bin at her local convenience store . Stacey and her son Eddie live in a 15 sq ft one-room bedsit . She is also adamant that her son Eddie won't ever rely on handouts from the state. She says: 'Eddie's going to be an astronaut or a judge. 'He'll be going to full school, college and university - I want him to have everything. 'When he gets older, he'll have a career and get no benefits.' The programme shows Stacey trying to eke out her £56 a week on food from the out-of-date bin in her local convenience store, and revealing that she once fainted  from hunger. She said: 'I've been really hungry - I've passed out on the street before because I haven't eaten.' Towards the end of the programme, Stacey is seen going down to the council offices to apply for a larger place for to live with her son. But the housing offices are unable to help and she walks away empty-handed, back to the room where she is forced to bathe her son in a sink because she doesn't have a bath.

Well you’re in luck, because a fresh mug of tea is now available at the touch of a button – from your coffee machine. Two British firms have joined forces to launch tea capsules which can be used in existing Nespresso machines. The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod made by Dualit – a brand best-known for its toasters and kettles. The Cornish Tea Company (pictured) will provide the leaves for a revolutionary tea capsule made by Dualit . Coffee drinkers have long enjoyed the merits of capsules, which provide instant hot drinks from machines made by Nespresso, Krups and Nescafe. But now tea drinkers can enjoy the same benefits with Dualit pods which are filled with tea from the family-run Cornish company. The pods are also compatible with Dualit’s own range of coffee machines, but do not come cheap. A single cup of tea will cost 30p – 15 times more than a typical 2p tea bag. Duncan Bond, director of the Cornish Tea Company, said: ‘We are terrifically proud to be the first tea brand in the world to be launching a Nespresso-compatible capsule. It’s never been done before and it has tremendous global potential. ‘When tea bags were first introduced people said they’d never catch on, now they are 97 per cent of the market. This could have a similar impact.’ Mr Bond, who founded the business with his nephew in 2012, added: ‘Many of our consumers lead very busy lives and this is not only incredibly convenient – the quality of the cup of tea is absolutely, scientifically consistent every time.’ The pods were developed last year after High Court judges ruled Dualit’s coffee capsules – which can also be used in Nespresso machines – did not infringe owner Nestle’s patents. The tea capsules, made by Dualit (left) which is best known for its kettles and toasters, can be used in existing Nespresso machines (right) The decision has blown open the tea and coffee capsules market, and Dualit has invested £1million in a new factory to meet the expected demand. The company started selling its own-brand tea capsules late last year but this is the first branded tea product to be made into a capsule. Dualit's Managing Director Leslie Gort-Barten said the Cornish Tea Company, based in Looe, Cornwall, was the perfect partner for the product. 'Cornish Tea are passionate, they are enthusiastic - they are player-managers in the same sense we are,' he said. 'The bigger a company gets, the more risk averse and blind to opportunity it can become. They weren't.

A mortuary cremated the wrong body at the funeral of Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn in an astonishing mix-up which saw the politician's family bid farewell to a stranger with the same name. Mr Bradbourn died shortly after being re-elected as an MEP for the West Midlands. The 63-year-old had been battling bowel cancer. But at a ceremony at Bushbury Crematorium in Wolverhampton on January 16, another man's body was cremated in his place. The blunder came after officials confused the politician's coffin with that of Philip Bradburn, an unknown man whose own funeral had been arranged by social services. Mr Bradbourn's family slammed the mix-up after having to hold a second funeral for him the following month. The 63-year-old died in Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield in December after battling the disease. His body was taken to the Central England Co-operative Funeralcare mortuary, where another man, Philip Bradburn, also lay. Mr Bradburn died in Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth's Hospital around the same time. A month after the funeral, Mr Bradbourn's family were told of the blunder. Earlier this week politicians gathered to pay their respects to Mr Bradbourn at St Peter’s Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton. Yesterday Tory West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre spoke of her horror at learning her former colleague's body had been mixed up. 'I attended Phil’s funeral in January and it was a smallish affair which was what Phil wanted. It was very moving and his friends planned a memorial day in March. 'I was telephoned by his executor informing me that a man with a very similar name had died and his body was mistakenly cremated. Mr Bradbourn died shortly after being re-elected as an MEP for the West Midlands. The 63-year-old had been battling bowel cancer . Mr Bradbourn was taken to Bushbury Cemetery and Crematorium in Wolverhampton (above) after losing his battle with cancer . The 63-year-old was being treated at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield which has launched an investigation into the incident . Another man, called Philip Bradburn, had also been taken to the crematorium from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham (above) 'It is deeply distressing and my first thought was there has been a family who have been robbed of a funeral for their loved one. 'My understanding is that the gentleman did not have any close family or relatives but nevertheless this should not be allowed to happen. Mr Bradbourn (pictured in 2005) spent 20 years in local government before becoming a political adviser . 'The hospital trust has launched an investigation and I know that serious questions have been sent right to the top of Government on this issue.' It is not clear whose shoulders the mistake falls on but all parties involved said they were conducting investigations into the incident. 'We are very sorry that this has happened - we are carrying out a full and urgent investigation between all the parties involved. 'This is a rare incident and we are offering support to those close to the deceased,' said Andrew Catto of Good Hope Hospital, where Mr Bradbourn died. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Queen Elizabeth, where Mr Bradburn died, said: 'We have been asked to be part of the investigation into this unfortunate incident and will fully co-operate with the parties involved.' A spokesperson for Central England Co-operative Funeralcare said: 'The Society is supporting one of our partners in a full and open an investigation, but is not able to comment further while the investigation is ongoing.' Mr Bradbourn had been a town planning officer in local government for more than 20 years before becoming political adviser to the Conservative group at Wolverhampton City Council. He was awarded an OBE in 1994 for his public and political service. At the time of his death Prime Minister David Cameron led tributes to the 'dedicated' and 'well-respected' politician who served in the European Parliament since 1999.

The technical area of the KC Stadium seems to have a way of bringing out the worst in managers - only last year Alan Pardew attempted a headbutt on Hull's David Meyler. So, with Tuesday night's flare-up in mind, Sportsmail looks back at our top 10 technical area spats. Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have now shaken hands . Bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with Poyet on the touchline . Things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Alan Pardew swears at Manuel Pellegrini, January 11, 2014 . The sight of a 52-year-old man calling a 60-year-old a 'f***ing old c***' seemed to shock many - and Pardew later apologised for his 'heat-of-the-moment' outburst. A Newcastle goal disallowed for offside while Pellegrini's Manchester City were 1-0 up prompted the row between the two bosses and as the fourth official looked to separate them Pardew had a pop at his opposite number. The FA 'reminded him of his responsibilites' - a bit of a let-off for the man now in charge of Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew (centre) and Manuel Pellegrini clashed over a disallowed goal back in 2014 . Martin Jol and Arsene Wenger let off steam, April 22, 2006 . For such a usually mild-mannered man, Wenger does seem to get into his fair share of rows with other managers - and on this occasion it was Tottenham's Martin Jol. Jol's side refused to put the ball out in the build-up to Robbie Keane scoring an opening goal at Highbury while Arsenal had a man down. This infuriated Wenger, who was challenged on his views by Jol. They were separated by the fourth official but Wenger still had to go back for one last pop at Jol - and he perhaps had the last laugh with Arsenal equalising and eventually pipping Spurs to fourth place in the Premier League by two points. Arsene Wenger (left) and Martin Jol had a disagreement over putting the ball out of play for an injury . Jose Mourinho vs Arsene Wenger, October 5, 2014 . These two have history dating back 11 years, and they still don't seem to get on to this day. Mourinho's arrival in the Premier League back in 2004, when Wenger's Arsenal were champions, heralded the end of the north London club's annual title hopes - and Mourinho certainly has a way of getting under his opposite number's skin. Just over 12 months after his return to the Premier League in 2013 and he was winding up Wenger again. The Frenchman took exception to Gary Cahill's challenge on Alexis Sanchez in a 2-0 Chelsea win at Stamford Bridge and stepped into Mourinho's allocated area. Some verbals from the Special One saw the pair come face-to-face before Wenger pushed the Blues boss in the chest. He later said he had 'nothing to apologise for'. Wenger pushes Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho during Chelsea's clash with Arsenal this season . Mourinho was furious with Wenger's behaviour and even brings up the lack of punishment to this day . The pair have history and have consistently rowed since Mourinho arrived in England back in 2004 . Kenny Dalglish tells Arsene Wenger to 'f*** off', April 17, 2011 . The third of a Wenger trio of incidents - but on this occasion he was remarkably restrained. Arsenal looked to have kept their title hopes alive at the Emirates Stadium with a Robin van Persie penalty eight minutes into stoppage time but Dirk Kuyt kept his cool to slot in a 102nd-minute spot-kick to level things and effectively hand the title to Manchester United. Liverpool manager Dalglish wasn't too happy with Wenger's touchline protests and at the whistle after Kuyt converted he approached the Arsenal boss with his arms outstretched and shouted 'It's a penalty, p*** off!' before adding 'It's a penalty, f*** off!'. It's fair to say he got his point across. David Moyes takes on Roberto Mancini, March 25, 2010 . Moyes was criticised for his lack of results against big clubs but on this occasion his Everton side managed a win at the Etihad Stadium - and wound up his opposite number at the same time. Both managers were sent off following a physical confrontation with Mancini trying to barge Moyes out of the way and then seeing the Scot square up to him. They were escorted down the tunnel by police such was the animosity. However, the pair shook hands after being told they had to share a lift to watch the rest of the game from the upper tier. Awkward. Roberto Mancini pushes David Moyes during their spells as Manchester City and Everton managers . Referee Peter Walton saw the stoppage-time clash worthy of sending both managers to the stands . Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon square up, March 2, 2011 . Old firm clashes always tend to be heated occasions, whether in the stands or on the field, but McCoist and Lennon extended the rowing into the technical area back in 2011. Three red cards, 13 cautions and 34 arrests at Celtic Park told the story of the afternoon and McCoist angered the home dugout with something he said at the final whistle. The two squared up and pushed each other before being pulled apart. McCoist got a two-match ban for his troubles while Lennon's previous record saw him take a four-game suspension, but the Northern Irishman would have been the happier after a 1-0 win. Neil Lennon makes his point clear to Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist on the Celtic Park touchline . Nigel Pearson's grip on James McArthur, February 7, 2015 . Even a month on, nobody really seems to understand what was going through Pearson's head on the touchline at the King Power Stadium. What started out as a jokey exchange suddenly became more sinister as the Leicester boss seemed to pin down the Crystal Palace midfielder by the throat as he looked to resume play with a throw-in. The fact that Pearson had failed in a bid to sign McArthur a few months back added to the confusion. Pearson appeared to grab McArthur around the throat and the floored player was seen mouthing 'get off me'. Things got even more strange in the aftermath when Pearson dismissed the incident as 'light-hearted' and told journalists that he could 'look after himself' and then seemed close to the sack before eventually keeping his job. Nigel Pearson clashed with James McArthur when Leicester hosted Crystal Palace last month . Leicester City boss Pearson (left) appears to put his hands towards the neck of  McArthur in February . Jose Mourinho's gouge on Tito Vilanova, August 17, 2011 . It's a rare occasion that the Special One admits he was in the wrong, but he did here, which gives you an idea of how shameful his actions were towards Pep Guardiola's then-assistant. During a familiar Spanish Super Cup El Clasico clash, Mourinho stole up behind Vilanova while a touchline row was already going on and jabbed a finger into his eye. Vilanova shoved back and both were handed bans. 'I should not have done what I did, obviously not,' Mourinho later said. 'The person who messed up there was me.' Joe Jordan rows with Gennaro Gattuso, February 16, 2011 . Recognised as two hard-nuts of the game, not many people were keen to get between Gattuso and Jordan as they rowed at the San Siro. Having been beaten by Tottenham at home in the Champions League, Gattuso seemed to want to distract from the defeat by picking on the Spurs bench. A fierce full-time shouting match between the two ended with the Italian grabbing the Spurs man by the throat before aiming a headbutt at him. Gattuso got a four-match ban, but given Jordan's record as a player he was probably lucky Harry Redknapp's No 2 didn't have a go back - and the Tottenham manager admitted as much. Joe Jordan and Gennaro Gattuso come close after Tottenham's win over AC Milan in the San Siro . Gattuso grabs Tottenham's assistant by the throat as Spurs manager Harry Redknapp tries to seperate them . Alan Pardew headbutts David Meyler, March 1, 2014 . Pardew, then Newcastle United boss, was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler at the KC Stadium. With the Magpies 3-1 up, Meyler shoved past Pardew as he went to retrieve the ball for a throw-in - and the Newcastle boss was unimpressed, coming together with the Hull player and pushing his head into his face. He received a £100,000 fine from his club, £60,000 from the FA, was given a formal warning by Newcastle and was slapped with a three-match stadium ban and a touchline ban for a further four games by the Football Association. Pardew's punishment represented the longest ban for a manager in England since 1989 - and he also underwent anger management counselling in the aftermath. Pardew and Hull City's David Meyler confront each other on the touchline at the KC Stadium last season . Pardew appeared to lay a headbutt on Meyler in ridiculous scenes while Howard Webb watched on .

'This particular instance occurred during hours when the day care was not in operation. 'However, the idea that people are doing drugs and selling drugs in what we would consider a safe haven for children is concerning.' Varano's mother Kelly L.

In January, North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Jong Un toured the factory and asked it to produce chewing gum. Food security remains poor for most North Koreans.

Wall Street executive Lynn Tilton, 55, of Patriarch Partnership is accused of hiding poorly performing investments among some of her dealings with distressed companies. The high-profile investor seeks out companies facing financial problems and attempts to turn them into profitable businesses. Lynn Tilton, pictured, has vowed to defend herself against charges that she defrauded her investors . However, the SEC believes that Ms Tilton failed to adequately tell people who invested more than $2.5 billion in some of her companies that they continued to face financial difficulties. The SEC said alleged fraud has continued since 2003. The SEC's decision to prosecute Tilton is seen as an attempt by government regulators to impose standards on Wall Street. President Obama has recently announced tougher restrictions on brokers who advise Americans over their retirement accounts. The SEC claims that Tilton failed her legal duty to clients to warn that some of the companies she had invested their money in were performing worse than expected. In its filing to a New York court the SEC said that Tilton 'intentionally and consistently directed' that the value of the assets remained unchanged even though they were worth less. The court documents said that three of the funds had under performed and Tilton had failed to pass this information on to her clients. The Securities and Exchange Commission claims that Tilton, second right, failed to properly inform her clients that some of the investment products had not been performing as well as they had anticipated . Tilton's company dismissed the allegations claiming that the SEC action was 'ill-founded and at odds with Patriarch's investment strategy, which was consistently disclosed since the inception of the funds. 'We look forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend ourselves against the SEC's allegations.' Tilton told CNBC that despite the SEC's case against her, she will continue to run more than 70 companies in her portfolio. She said: 'I am shocked. I am disappointed, saddened and ... I am certain that the allegations are ill-founded.' She said the case was 'the ultimate battle in good against evil, light against dark.' She added: 'My number one priority is protecting my company and my people so that I can maximize the value of the funds. My people need to know that I am fighting for them. I also want to live in a country where I can fight for truth without assuming that because it's the government that I am guilty without the battle. As someone who has always fought for truth, and protected her integrity and her intent, and have prevailed, I expect to do that.'

Only one year after a new regulator was tasked with keeping loan companies in check, many are still employing bully boy tactics when a customer defaults on their repayments. The Financial Conduct Authority found that certain firms continued to be 'unsympathetic and inflexible' where a customer was in 'distress and financial difficulty'. The watchdog said one lender had even tried to extract money from customers by 'threatening visits to their home or place of work', despite having no policy to do so. Hounded: A year after the Financial Conduct Authority was tasked with regulating payday lenders, its report finds the firms are still hounding vulnerable customers (file photo) Others threatened to pass on customers' accounts to external debt collectors, even though they had no intention of doing so. The FCA said it uncovered 'misleading and occasionally threatening correspondence from lenders', despite an attempt to clamp down on such behaviour. David Mann, at comparison site uSwitch.com, said last night: 'It's shocking that vulnerable people are still being hounded, even when they're taking steps to get their debts under control. 'It's clear that more needs to be done to protect those trapped in a vicious circle of debt. 'There is a need for short term credit, but payday loans can be a very expensive way to borrow money. We need high street banks to step up and offer robust short term lending solutions.' Last April, the FCA was put in charge of regulating the payday industry in an attempt to tackle the number of people spiralling into unmanageable debt through these high-interest short-term loans. But the FCA's own report found evidence that high-risk applicants were still being accepted for loans, even where lenders had 'grounds to suspect that customers were at risk of, or already in, financial difficulties'. They said shambolic record-keeping meant calls and emails from customers admitting they were in difficulty and could not pay often 'fell through gaps' in the system. In some cases, companies had a backlog of correspondence from debt advice charities stretching back several weeks, meaning lenders were completely unaware of why customers had defaulted on their loan. This included medical evidence which would have explained why someone had stopped repaying their debt. Vulnerable: The FCA's own report found evidence that high-risk applicants were still being accepted for loans . 'In many cases, these customers were still being chased for their debts through daily letters, emails and phone calls', the FCA said. Even lenders which had logged details of customers' personal circumstances, including illness or bereavement, sometimes failed to tell debt collectors this. Some firms were also short-staffed and inadequately trained to deal with complex arrears cases, it added. However, it said some positive changes and been made and that most firms had significantly reduced the amount of fees and interest they charged customers who had fallen behind with their repayments. Joanna Elson, at the Money Advice Trust charity, said payday lenders must 'drastically improve the way they treat customers in financial difficulty'. She said: 'While the improvements already being made by firms are welcome, the FCA has been very clear that many are struggling with the pace of change required to bring them up to scratch.' The Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes when financial firms and consumers cannot come to an agreement, said it has seen vulnerable payday loan customers being treated in an 'alarming' way. The ombudsman has seen a 64 per cent increase in payday lending complaints since 2012 and it is currently taking on more than 70 new cases each month. It is finding in consumers' favour in around two-thirds of cases. The main complaint it deals with is a loan provider being unwilling to accept a suitable repayment plan, as well as poor administration and customer service. Gillian Guy, of Citizens' Advice Bureau, said: 'Some of the worst debt collection practices people tell us about come from payday lenders. 'People have sought our help after their lender told colleagues about their debts or pretended that they were bailiffs and threatened to seize belongings from their home. 'Important progress has been made since tougher FCA rules came in but many people are still falling foul of irresponsible lending. 'Payday loan firms should only lend to people who they know can afford to pay back the debt, and must point those who can't towards free debt advice.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lenders still 'bullying' customers suffering from illness and bereavement .\nFinancial Conduct Authority claims firms continue to be 'unsympathetic'\nOne even threatened to visit customer's home despite policy forbidding it .\nLast year, FCA was tasked with regulating high-interest short-term loans .\nIts own report has found high-risk applicants still being accepted for loans ."}]}

The Prime Minister insisted he had nothing against 'the entire seagull population', despite committing £250,000 in the Budget to tackling the scourge of Britain's seaside towns. An 'urban seagull' research fund will be used to find a solution for the noise, mess, disease and aggression caused by the birds. An 'urban seagull' research fund has been set up to find a solution for the noise, mess, disease and aggression caused by the birds . Despite efforts from local councils including using artificial eggs and experimenting with stronger refuse bags, the gull population in the UK is thought to have grown to more than a quarter of a million breeding pairs. Last year, councils in the seaside resorts of Exmouth, Sidmouth and Seaton in Devon spent £15,000 on specially-bred 'super falcons' to try to stop seagulls from disturbing residents and tourists. In 2013, Royal Mail said postmen would not deliver in a street in the Cornish coastal town of Perranporth after being injured by the swooping birds who dive-bomb and peck at their heads. Asked whether he had ever been attacked by seagulls, the Prime Minister told the Western Morning News he had never felt 'particularly oppressed by seagulls'. But he revealed: 'In my distant past I remember some seagulls taking the ham out of a sandwich. But I haven't held that against the entire seagull population since.' Bath MP Don Foster, who held a 'seagull summit' in Parliament in 2012, said: 'Urban gulls cause mess, noise and damage to property, and are very aggressive in the nesting season. 'There is not enough data to enable a strategic approach to the problem, and I have long been pressing for funding to be given so that progress can be made.' David Cameron, pictured at today's EU summit in Brussels, backed a Government review into Britain's seagull menace – after a bird once stole the ham from his sandwich . Labour have claimed the seagull fund and other small measures in the Budget are little more than 'pork barrel politics' aimed at winning over marginal seats have been dismissed by the coalition. At least 16 marginal constituencies benefited from measures in the Budget, including £97 million for regeneration in Brent Cross, which straddles the ultra-marginal Hendon constituency where Conservative MP Matthew Offord has a majority of 106. Lib Dem sources insisted the seagull study was aimed at tackling the problem nationwide and the Treasury said the Chancellor had set out economic plans for every region in the country. Mr Foster has campaigned for action to be taken to tackle the 'menace' since before the Lib Dems entered government and hosted a 'seagull summit' three years ago. A Liberal Democrat source said: 'It's just silly stuff from an Opposition trying to cause mischief. 'Urban seagulls are a serious issue across the country and Don Foster has fought a campaign to get a proper study done so they can be properly dealt with.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'From investing £13 billion to improving transport across of the whole of the north of England to introducing 20 housing zones around the country to keep Britain building, from day one this Government has been committed to building a truly national recovery to close the long-term gaps between the north and south, London and the rest. 'The Chancellor has set out long-term economic plans for every region to make sure that Britain's prosperity is shared across the country and the Budget took this even further with ambitious investment in a wide range of areas like enterprise zones, flood defence and science to ensure that no industry and no region is left behind.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David Cameron insisted he had nothing against 'entire seagull population'\nBut the PM said one had once swooped on him to steal part of his lunch .\nBudget committed £250,000 to an 'urban seagull' research fund .\nIt will find a solution for the noise, mess and disease caused by the birds ."}]}

The midfielder fought back after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago but after a lengthy lay-off struggled to keep his place in the national team and at Manchester United. However, the 31-year-old is enjoying a new lease of life at West Brom after joining the Baggies in the winter transfer window and Gordon Strachan asked him to lead out the Scots in Wednesday night's 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland at Hampden Park, as recent skipper Scott Brown was rested. Darren Fletcher brings the ball under control during Scotland's 1-0 win over Northern Ireland . 'It was great to be back,' said Fletcher. 'You are representing your country, you are captain, you win a game at home against Northern Ireland, it is things you thought about doing when you were going through tough times. 'It was a while since I played at Hampden, I was thinking that driving in. But I really enjoyed it and the pitch was really good as well. 'Scott wasn't starting so it was my turn to step up and be captain. I have said before, I am what I am now on and captain or not, I am going to be exactly the same. 'We have a lot of leaders in that dressing room which is important. 'There is competition for places which is great. It means I have to step up my performance when I play. 'It is great for the manager and great for the squad that we are all pushing each other and performing well. Fletcher wins a challenge against former Manchester United team-mate Jonny Evans . 'I feel great. I feel stronger with every 90 minutes and I am seeing improvement all the time so hopefully there is more to come as well.' The match served as a warm-up for Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Group D minnows Gibraltar at the national stadium on Sunday and it took a late Christophe Berra header to separate the teams. The Scots are all but certain to move on to 10 points after five fixtures against UEFA's newest member but Fletcher is too long in the tooth to go overboard about qualification hopes. Since making his debut under Berti Vogts in a friendly against Norway in 2003, Scotland have failed six times to qualify for a major finals. He said: 'We have great confidence in ourselves and in the group but I have been in this position before with Scotland and we have not managed to see it over the line. 'Everything we have done up until now has been great but the hard work is still to come. Fletcher was thrilled to be back captaining his country after a long absence . 'You have to keep reiterating that. We have an important match on Sunday. 'Win that and that takes us into the qualifier in June (away to Republic of Ireland) which is going to be an important game but there is still a lot of work to do.' 'We have put ourselves in a great position but the hard work begins now and let's see it out.' Fletcher believes patience on and off the pitch will be key against a Gibraltar side who, after failing to score a goal, far less win a point, in four games, will have damage limitation on their minds. He said: 'Hopefully the fans are patient with us when we are trying to play our football and break teams down.

Already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year, one final blast of beleaguered referee Craig Thomson’s whistle at Tannadice ensured yet another instalment of this saga. In the movie business, each successive film in a franchise tends to be markedly poorer than its predecessor. And as the dust settled on this breathtaking and at times bewildering contest of almost incessant controversy, the suspicion lingered that nothing that lies ahead in March could possibly match this blockbuster for drama, action and utter high farce. For on an astonishing Scottish Cup afternoon on Tayside, nine-man United fought to a valiant 1-1 draw against their 10-man visitors. This was a game scarred by two early red cards, ultimately three in total, but, in truth, there could have been five. One, dished out to the luckless Paul Paton, was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . Adding to the scandal, Nadir Ciftci, the United striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team-mate Aidan Connolly appeared to dive to win a penalty, should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at Scott Brown. The Celtic captain was, himself, lucky to escape red for a quite awful challenge on the Turkish forward in the first place. And even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain-to-hero story, as Leigh Griffiths missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding United keeper Rado Cierzniak. Griffiths’ beautiful header secured a replay at Parkhead on March 18 – the second of three games in a week between the teams – although the Celtic striker may now relinquish penalty duties. ‘I had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it,’ said Griffiths. ‘I’d been practising in training all day yesterday [Saturday] and never missed a single one. I apologised to the fans because I never scored. It was my fault and if Kris Commons is back in the team next week he will be back on them because he’s No1 penalty taker. But if not I will put my hand up to take one because I am always confident. ‘Their goalie’s had one of those games, he saved everything we threw at him. I hope he’s not in that form in the final next week or we could be in trouble. But it was nice that I picked myself up to score.' The referee points to the spot after Aidan Connolly was brought down in the Celtic box . Celtic keeper Craig Gordon fails to stop Nadir Ciftci from giving Dundee Utd the lead . Dundee United's Nadir Ciftci celebrates scoring the opening goal with a penalty . The tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when Brown went in hard on Ciftci. He retaliated with a kick towards the Celtic skipper’s head. In the same melee, Calum Butcher slid into Virgil van Dijk, who appeared to stamp down on the United man as the pair tangled on the ground. And yet, after a three-minute discussion between referee Thomson and his assistant Graham Chambers, red cards were issued to van Dijk and, astonishingly, the apparently blameless Paton instead of Butcher. As he trudged off, Paton’s face was the picture of incredulity. This season he has already been banned for two games for allegedly spitting at Aberdeen’s Johnny Hayes – despite his ‘victim’ protesting that Paton was innocent. Paton recently insisted he was the victim of unfair treatment from the SFA because he elected to play for Northern Ireland over Scotland. That, of course, remains a nonsense but he was right to feel aggrieved. As half-time approached, United nearly took the lead when Butcher’s mis-hit shot was diverted past Craig Gordon by Ryan Dow but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety. Then, after a lighting break, Celtic raced up to the other end and great play from Stefan Johansen saw him cleverly slip the ball in for Anthony Stokes. The forward was clean through on goal, and took two touches before picking his spot. Unfortunately for him, however, the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by United’s relieved defence. Whether or not the ball took a bobble on the pitch, only Stokes will know, but it looked a real sitter. Worse was to come for the Irishman when young Connolly drove at the Celtic defence and appeared to throw himself to the ground with Stokes nearby. Dundee United have a second player sent off after Paul Dixon (3rd left) receives his marching orders . Griffiths missed his chance to equalise for Celtic from the penalty spot . It looked a dive but Ciftci didn’t care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving Gordon. As the teams left the park at half-time Emilio Izaguirre was furious at the award of the spot kick. But it was the Honduran’s misplaced clearance into the path of Connolly that had put his team under pressure in the first place. It was a crazy conclusion to the first half but the second period immediately brought fresh madness. Within three minutes, Dundee United were down to nine men when Griffiths’ shot struck Paul Dixon on the arm as the United defender attempted to block. Griffiths caught the ball well but United goalkeeper Cierzniak, so often criticised, pulled off a wonderful save to prevent Celtic levelling. With United moving to a 5-3-0 formation, it was like the Alamo at times but there were great saves to come from Cierzniak - from both Stokes and substitute John Guidetti. Griffiths makes up for his penalty miss by drawing Celtic level with a header . Celtic captain Scott Brown celebrates with Griffiths as the game finishes in a 1-1 draw . Despite the one-way traffic, however, Gordon had to look lively to stop Butcher scoring on a rare United counter. Just as it looked like Celtic’s treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor Tannadice pitch, Griffiths gained his redemption. Running on to Stefan Johansen’s beautifully-flighted ball, he nodded expertly beyond Cierzniak. From then on in, United nine men battled valiantly to remain in the hunt for a semi-final spot. ‘It will be a tough game at Hampden against Inverness or Raith,’ nodded Griffiths after the draw was made. ‘Either side will make it hard for us - but that’s only if we get through by finishing the job at Parkhead. But we know Dundee United will make it tough for us.’ At the end of a quite thrilling encounter, United had sent out a clear message ahead of the sequel, next Sunday’s League Cup final at Hampden.

Cole was involved in a Twitter spat with a Tottenham Hotspur fan after West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at White Hart Lane on February 22 and replied to an insult with a tweet saying 'F off you c***'. He later deleted the message. The 31-year-old, who has 122,000 followers on the social networking site, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' West Ham striker Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 for tweeting a fan saying 'F off you c***' last month . Cole tweeted back to a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, telling the  supporter: 'F off you c***' Carlton Cole is far from the first footballer to have be censured over his behaviour on Twitter: . Darren Bent, 2009 - £120,000 fine . Bent was fined by his club Tottenham for a blast at chairman Daniel Levy. He tweeted: ‘Do I wanna go Hull City NO. Do I wanna go Stoke NO do I wanna go Sunderland YES so stop f****** around levy.’ Carlton Cole, 2011 - £20,000 fine . Cole tweeted during England's friendly with Ghana saying: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!' Rio Ferdinand, 2012 - £45,000 fine . Ferdinand appeared to endorse a tweet by another user  which described  Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice', a term said to mean a person is black on the outside but white on the inside. Ashley Cole, 2012 - £90,000 fine . Cole was unimpressed with the FA's judgement in the John Terry racism case, tweeting: 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFT***S' Michael Chopra, 2014 - £15,000 fine . Referring to life at crisis club Blackpool, Chopra posted: ‘F****** joke this come in training only 6 f****** players here then find out the fitness coach taken the football session #joke.’ Rio Ferdinand, 2014 - three match ban and £25,000 fine . QPR defender used the word 'sket' in reference to another Twitter user's mother this season. Cole, who has over 100,000 Twitter followers, was also 'severely warned' as to his future conduct by the FA. An FA statement said: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, Carlton Cole has been fined £20,000 after he admitted breaching FA Rules in relation to social media.' 'The West Ham United player, who was also severely warned as to his future conduct, admitted posting a comment on his Twitter account which was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, in breach of FA Rule E3.' The former Chelsea striker has been in trouble before for previous postings on social media and that may be taken into account in his punishment. He was fined £20,000 by the FA in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap! 'The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!' Cole, who is currently recovering from a hamstring injury that forced him off during the game at Tottenham, will look at Rio Ferdinand as an example of how to avoid future misdeameanours. The QPR defender was handed a three-game ban earlier this season for a second FA charge over social media activities - with the former England captain not contesting the suspension despite labelling the severity of the decision as 'crazy'.

Henry has hailed Rooney as one of the greats of the game with the 29-year-old England captain just two goals from equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 49 goals for his country. And the former Arsenal and Barcelona striker insists that young players like Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling must not waste their training sessions alongside Rooney. Thierry Henry (right) and Wayne Rooney pictured alongside each other during a Premier League match in 2002 . Wayne Rooney celebrates his 47th goal for England against Lithuania on Friday night . Henry wrote in The Sun: 'You will only truly appreciate Rooney when he has retired. It's a shame but it's always like hat. 'I would absolutely urge all those youngsters in the squad, such as Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, to watch and learn off Rooney from this day onwards. 'They are extremely lucky to be on the same training pitch as this guy and they must make the most of it. It will be a real waste if they do not. 'They must try to copy him.

'To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes and it isn't easy. 'Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player.' Meanwhile, Rooney has admitted that the excitement generated by Kane, who scored just 79 seconds after coming on as a substitute in the 4-0 win over Lithuania, reminds him of his early games for England at the age of 17. Rooney was a teenage sensation for England twelve years ago and caused even more of a stir when he starred in England’s 2-0 win over Turkey in 2003. Rooney said: ‘There was one stage in the game, after his [Kane's] goal, where he ran down the left and took a few players on which reminded me of that.

You can feel the excitement around the country. You could tell when he came on everyone wanted him to come on and even he himself didn't think he'd score so quick, but we are all delighted for him. 'He's an exciting player. When you speak to him you can see he is a level headed guy and I am sure he has good people around him so will be able to cope with it.

The education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs. Yesterday a Parliamentary committee probing Ofsted’s work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection – to ensure large-scale abuse isn’t being ignored elsewhere. Clive Betts, chairman of the Communities and Local Government committee, said Ofsted’s ‘credibility is on the line’. The Labour MP added: ‘The perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham but the ineffectiveness of Ofsted’s inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem.’ The fierce attack came on the day a second group of MPs found flaws in Ofsted’s handling of the Trojan Horse affair, in which Birmingham schools were accused of fostering religious extremism. The Commons education committee said little evidence of radicalisation had been found and ‘confidence in Ofsted has been undermined, and efforts should be made by the inspectorate to restore it’. Meanwhile, the Rotherham report pointed to Ofsted inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as ‘adequate’ – yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on. Instead, the inspectors simply accepted what they were told by local officials, and didn’t ask searching questions. ‘Ofsted does not appear to have probed beyond what it was told, and it failed to penetrate the professional jealousy and incompetence that distorted the operation of children’s social care in Rotherham,’ stated the report. It also described Ofsted’s habit of calling the efforts of councils like Rotherham adequate as ‘ambiguous’. While Ofsted thought ‘adequate’ meant that improvement was needed, outsiders, including councillors, thought it meant ‘satisfactory’. ‘Rotherham appears to have gone a step further and interpreted it as indicating a strong performance.’ The MPs added that Ofsted was operating in a way that meant its different inspectors and departments did not discuss their findings with each other – and inspections of councils like Rotherham were ‘too short and narrowly focused’. They relied on paperwork – rather than actuality – and on what they were told by councils, who did not pass on concerns raised by whistleblowers and others. The education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town (pictured) where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs . ‘We conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at Rotherham was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be,’ the MPs said. They called for Louise Casey – who was sent in by the Government to examine Rotherham’s failures after the scandal broke – to carry out a second inquiry to check that the town is working more effectively. A similar inquiry should be held into South Yorkshire Police, they said. And they were ‘uneasy’ about the way in which Ofsted polices itself as it ‘may not be sufficiently accountable for its performance’. Last night an Ofsted spokesman said: ‘We welcome the report and the committee’s recognition that the changes we have made since 2012 strengthen our ability to uncover where children are at risk. We know we didn’t get it right historically in Rotherham and have apologised for those mistakes.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs between 1997 and 2013 .\nMPs probing Ofsted's work there said the body's 'credibility is on the line'\nThey want inspections of all councils with child protection responsibilities .\nAttack came after fellow MPs found flaws in Ofsted’s handling of Trojan Horse affair ."}]}

But text speak has not been the disaster for language many feared and one leading linguist has claimed it actually improves people's writing and spelling. Professor David Crystal, an honorary professor at Bangor University, said those who text regularly were found to be 'concentrating their minds' on the relationship between sounds and  written words. The linguist, who has written more than 100 books on the English language, pointed out a new generation is 'constantly' reading and writing online. 'People say text messaging will harm your spelling. No...It helps you to spell better,' he said at the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai according to the Daily Telegraph. 'This is because it focuses your mind on the connection between sound and letters. 'The best texters are the best spellers. 'People say young people don't read and write any more.'They may not necessarily read... Shakespeare or Charles Dickens, but have you ever seen a teenager not reading? 'Young people read probably more than I did when I was that age.' He said the digital age had not necessarily heralded a 'linguistic revolution' in the way critics had predicted and said the 'moral panic' of the potential change has not been justified. Professor Crystal's studies have found around 2,000 new words developed as a result of the digital age, including terms such as blog and twittersphere. He said  additions have so far not had a major, or negative, impact on the English language, which has more than one million  words. The linguist said many abbreviations such as 'c u l8r' are not commonly used by modern teenagers. Professor Crystal also claimed that hashtags, used on Twitter, are simply a new method of managing and classifying information and were likely to stay. Professor David Crystal dismissed claims youngsters were not reading as much today as they had done in the past . His comments dispel previous claims abbreviated language was worsening teenagers' grasp of the English language. In 2012 a study claimed the grammar standards of school pupils aged 10-12 had slipped as a result of constantly using shortened phrases. Researchers urged parents not to communicate with their children in text speak to avoid their abilities suffering more. Last year it was claimed Britons spent more time using mobile phones, computers and handheld tablets than they did sleeping. Information gathered by Ofcom, the television watchdog, found the average adult slept for eight hours 21 minutes but spent 20 minutes longer connected to technology."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Professor David Crystal said texting improves people's writing and spelling .\nYoungsters are 'reading more than ever because they're glued to screens'\nThose constantly texting are 'concentrating' on words and sounds, he said ."}]}

The Football League's complex Financial Fair Play rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend. Earlier this month QPR announced they had made a loss of £9.8m but the accounts filed at Companies House now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners, mainly Tony Fernandes, writing off £60m of old loans in an 'exceptional item' in the accounts. QPR owner Tony Fernandes was among those to write off £60million of old loans to the London club . QPR's players get put through their paces in training ahead of Saturday's game against Crystal Palace . Q: Queens Park Rangers accounts for 2013-14 have now been filed in detail at Companies House. What do they show? A: They show that the club’s ‘true’ losses for last season were £69.8m, instead of the £9.8m declared by the club earlier this month. They used an accounting method, an ‘exceptional item’, to count a £60m write-off of loans to the owners as effective income. Their real income was £38.7m. Q: Why does this matter? A: Because if clubs lose lots of money in the Championship, where QPR played last season, they face potential ‘Financial Fair Play’ fines from the Football League. The FFP rules are in place to stop clubs ‘financial doping’ and stop them spending themselves to bankruptcy. To simplify: clubs that massively overspend, and lose lots of money as a result, face fans which grow in relation to the overspending. Q: How much fine do QPR face? A: If they’d really lost only £9.8m last season, the fine would have been tiny, perhaps not even a million pounds. But if the real loss is £69.8m, the fine could be as high as £58m, and is likely to be at least £50m. That would be the biggest fine on any club for any reason in global football history. Q: Who will decide? A: Lawyers, probably. The parties are locked in talks about what happens next. Q: What do QPR say? A: No comment. Effectively, QPR counted that £60m write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a 'related-party transaction' - and the Football League's own FFP rules explicitly rule out that related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken. The League rule out such moves in order to prevent 'artificially' lowered losses. A QPR spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have no comment.' A Football League spokesman reiterated an earlier League statement that the League remains in talks with QPR about the situation, but won't add details. If the League ultimately rule that QPR's 'real' losses are £69.8m, then the FFP fine they potentially face will be £57.9m. QPR will legitimately be able to write off some of that £69.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment, and some bonuses, for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of £50m-plus. Yet QPR are locked in legal arguments questioning whether the League have the right to levy any fine at all, and if they do, at what levels. QPR posted losses of £65.4m in the 2012-13 season and it was expected these might fall after cost-cutting in the Championship. But the new accounts show in fact that as QPR's income plunged from £60.6m in 2012-13 to £38.7m in 2013-14, there was no significant reduction in the biggest single outgoing - player wages. The wage bill was £78m in the 2012-13 season and £75.4m in 2013-14 in the Championship. Quite how this now plays out remains to be seen: lawyers are likely to remain occupied for weeks if not months or years on both sides. Junior Hoilett (centre) has an effort on goal as QPR prepare for a relegation clash at Selhurst Park . Striker Charlie Austin is in discussions over a new £60,000-a-week deal at Loftus Road . QPR could refuse to pay a Football League fine if Chris Ramsey keeps the club in the Premier League . If QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League this season, they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the Football League will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the Premier League - and outside Football League jurisdiction. The worst-case scenario for QPR is relegation to the Football League while continuing to refuse to pay a fine to the League, who have already said QPR would not be allowed back into the Championship if there was an outstanding fine unpaid. In other words, if QPR don't pay what the League ultimately demand and go down, they face the nightmare prospect of a drop to non-league football. Their lawyers are believed to be considering all options to prevent this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "QPR announced a loss of £9.8million up to May 2014 earlier this month .\nTheir 'real' loss was almost £70m after £60m of  loans were written off .\nThe London club could face a Football League fine of more than £50m .\nThey will not be allowed to play in the Championship if they do not pay .\nBut  QPR cannot be forced to pay while they are in the Premier League .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest QPR news ."}]}

However, when the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new 'orange' coiffure violated the school's dress and grooming code. In writing: Indeed, the rules state that non-natural hair colors are not permitted . Speaking out: However Savannah argues that her shoulder-length hair isn't purple, green or blue and only a little brighter than her natural shade Her 40-year-old mother (pictured) agrees . But Savannah said that the principal told her to call her mother on Tuesday to be picked up. She then tried to return to lessons the following day but was instructed to stay at home because her hair remained unchanged. West St. Francois County superintendent Stacy Stevens said she couldn't comment specifically on Savannah's situation, but he says the hair color policy has been in place for decades. 'We try to work with the students to be fair. We don't want them out of school, we don't typically have issues with this policy. I think our students and parents are accepting of it. It's been in place a long time, and I think it's a policy that works.' Savannah refuses to dye her hair back to its original color as a matter of principal. She plans to appeal the principal and superintendent’s decision and take it before the school board. Her mother, meanwhile, wishes the school would worry about bigger issues. 'Instead of maybe picking up on the bullying, and kids who are actually causing trouble, its hair color,' she concluded. Superintendent Stacy Steven has since told DailyMail.com that the hair dye issue has been resolved but she was 'unable to go into specifics'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Savannah Keesee from Farmington, Missouri, used a Garnier-brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair while she was snowedin at home .\nWhen the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue .\nThe principal said her new coiffure violated the school's dress code .\nSavannah was told to call her mother to be picked up .\nShe apparently has been banned from classes until she recolors her hair ."}]}

A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists. In an experiment, German researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high-salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly. Too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections, new research found . This is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages, making their immune systems more responsive. The findings, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented. Professor Jonathan Jantsch, of the University of Regensburg, said: 'Up to now, salt has been regarded as a detrimental dietary factor; it is clearly known to be detrimental for cardiovascular diseases, and recent studies have implicated a role in worsening autoimmune diseases. 'Our current study challenges this one-sided view and suggests that increasing salt accumulation at the site of infections might be an ancient strategy to ward off infections, long before antibiotics were invented.' High levels of sodium stored in the skin, especially in the elderly, can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for heart disease and stroke, worsen autoimmune disease and even increase the risk of stomach cancer. Professor Jens Titze from Vanderbilt University added: 'Despite the overwhelming evidence linking dietary salt to disease in humans, the potential evolutionary advantage of storing so much salt in the body has not been clear.' A high-salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin, boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections, say scientists . The researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation. But in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages. This meant that mice who had infections in their feet caused by a parasite called Leishmania major were able to heal more quickly. Future studies will examine how salt accumulates in the skin and triggers immune responses, and why salt accumulates in the skin of ageing adults. Professor Jantsch went on: 'A further understanding of the regulatory cascades might not only help to design drugs that specifically enhance local salt deposition and help to combat infectious diseases, but also may lead to novel strategies to mobilise sodium stores in the ageing population and prevent cardiovascular disease. 'We also think that local application of high-salt-containing wound dressings and the development of other salt-boosting antimicrobial therapies might bear therapeutic potential.' But he warned everyone should not rush off and start a high salt diet. He added: 'Due to the overwhelming clinical studies demonstrating that high dietary salt is detrimental to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, we feel that at present our data does not justify recommendations on high dietary salt in the general population. 'Nevertheless, in situations where endogenous accumulation of salt to sites of infection is insufficient, supplementation of salt might be a therapeutic option. 'But this needs to be addressed in further studies.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Research has found eating salt can protect against skin infections .\nRaised sodium levels boost immune system and fight off germs .\nMice with a high-salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly .\nFindings by German researchers published in journal of Cell Metabolism ."}]}

They say they've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge Totten Glacier and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting. The glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in East Antarctica. It contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by at least 11 feet (3.4 meters), according to researchers from the University of Texas at Austin who were among the authors of a new study published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience. Scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier. But until now, they had found no evidence that it could threaten coastal ice. \"We now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in East Antarctica to access the most sensitive areas of Totten Glacier,\" said Jamin Greenbaum, a University of Texas Ph.D. candidate and the lead author of the study. The two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why Totten Glacier has been melting so fast. Scientists have already warned about the consequences of melting ice in West Antarctica. NASA said last year that glacial retreat in some areas \"appears unstoppable.\" The increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in Totten Glacier is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The United Nations' report on climate change last year estimated sea levels could rise between 1 foot and 3 feet by 2100. Such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world. But that calculation doesn't factor in the latest research on Antarctica. \"While the Totten melt may take several centuries, once change has begun our analysis reveals it would likely be irreversible,\" Greenbaum said in comments cited by the Australian Antarctic Division. To prevent the process from becoming unstoppable, atmospheric and oceanic conditions would need to change so that snowfall outpaces coastal melting, the researchers said. The scientists gathered their data through a series of aerial surveys using technology that can scan the ice and seafloors in areas that are inaccessible to icebreakers. The team included researchers from the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New study reveals openings that threaten huge glacier with warm water .\nTotten Glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in East Antarctica ."}]}

From what he has seen in his first season in the Aviva Premiership with Gloucester, Laidlaw reckons England’s players are anything but invincible. They are good, he says, but no better than those currently wearing the dark blue. Scotland captain greig Laidlaw (above) insists that England are not invincible ahead of Saturday's clash . ‘I’ve always thought highly of the England players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win,’ said Laidlaw. ‘They are not invincible, that’s definitely not the case. ‘I believe they are good players but you look at Glasgow Warriors when they played Bath in Europe this season and how well they did. ‘Bath were going well in the Premiership but Glasgow beat them at home and arguably could have won down there, too. It wasn’t really Glasgow’s first team as they had a lot of injuries that day — and it probably was close to Bath’s first team.’ Laidlaw’s emotions are running high ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash, especially after team-mate Stuart Hogg told Sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for Scottish rugby south of the border. Laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the Six Nations, based on the experiences of his first season with Gloucester, following his move from Edinburgh. Scotland full back Stuart Hogg (left) accused the English of lacking respect for Scottish rugby . For Laidlaw, a win at Twickenham will not only belatedly ignite Scotland’s Six Nations campaign, following defeats to France, Wales and Italy, it will give him bragging rights in the Gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a Scot south of the border. ‘Respect has to be earned and that is something we’ll be aiming to do at the weekend,’ he said. ‘The England boys will respect us if we do a job on the field. ‘We’re not far away from getting things right but I’m getting pretty sick of telling people that, I really am. It’s up to us as players to step up, go again and put in that performance against England. ‘We have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to Italy — but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change. ‘We have now seen both sides of Vern Cotter this week. He is a hard man and rightly so. He has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about — and that’s good. We know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from Twickenham with a positive result.’ Laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead Scotland to what would be a famous victory at Twickenham. The first is to emulate his uncle, Roy Laidlaw, who helped his team to a Calcutta Cup win back in 1983. The other is to wipe out the memory of last year’s 20-0 defeat by England at BT Murrayfield. It still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a Scotland shirt. England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield last year after a 20-0 victory . Nothing went right for Laidlaw that day and, after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game, the Scotland skipper was replaced by Chris Cusiter after 65 minutes. The boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt Laidlaw and he knows that defeat, on top of Scotland’s dreadful Six Nations campaign so far this season, makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of English rugby. ‘That was personally one of my worst games for Scotland, to be honest,’ he admitted. ‘I don’t think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason. ‘It was made worse because we were playing England. It is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud — and we didn’t. ‘Vern’s analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous Six Nations tournaments and he has been on our case. He has certainly been on my case, that’s for sure, after he brought up that match. ‘We’ve had a look at that last game when we lost 20-0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again. ‘We certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this Six Nations, if we can, by winning at Twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is England down there. ‘I’ve talked to my uncle Roy about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history. ‘It’s up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them — and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room.’ England centre Luther Burrell is mobbed by his team-mates after he scored a try in last year's match . Much will rest on the performance of second-row Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday. He has already come of age for Scotland and is calling the line-outs. In the absence of big brother Richie through injury, there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders. There was an indication against the Italians of how much Gray is respected by Cotter when, with Laidlaw taken off and vice-captain Ross Ford off injured, he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game. It was a dream come true for the second row, who knows he has a huge role to play against England. ‘It’s very special to be a part of the Scotland squad in the first place, then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about,’ he said. ‘To have done that, even if for only a couple of minutes against Italy, was a huge honour and a very special feeling. Jonny Gray (above) will have a big role to play if Scotland are to upset the odds and beat England . ‘The result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now. ‘We have been looking at the England game and what we need to fix and we’re just training hard to try to get it right. ‘It will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough England team. They have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs, so that is an area we will be working hard on this week.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scotland face England at Twickenham in the Six Nations on Saturday .\nScotland have lost all three matches so far in the Championship .\nStuart Hogg told Sportsmail the English lack respect for Scottish rugby .\nCaptain Greig Laidlaw says Scotland are as good as England ."}]}

Unions representing Qantas staff claim they've been inundated with complaints after flight attendants and pilots were moved to a hotel next door to the 'happiest place on earth' Disneyland and the busy convention centre. Qantas made the move from Costa Mesa, an hour and a half south of Los Angeles Airport, to the Anaheim Hilton in the last 12 months. In the last 12 months Qantas staff have been staying at The Anaheim Hilton which is right next door to Disneyland and its convention centre . Unions claim they have been inundated with complaints that staff are unable to sleep in the new accommodation Qantas is providing . This move follows airline chief Alan Joyce's announcement  of cost cuts worth $2 billion over three years after suffering losses in recent years. The new lodgings are about half-an-hour closer to the airport and reportedly cut accommodation costs by two-thirds, or approximately $100 per night. Flight Attendants Association Australia National Industrial Officer Steven Reed told Newscorp that flight attendants and pilots are unable to get adequate rest because of the noise coming from the theme park and its neighbouring convention centre. ‘By the time you get to the hotel you want to go for a walk and then get some rest, not face a rock band playing in the foyer and kids running up and down the halls.' He warned if crews aren't adequately rested they'll be required to report as ‘unfit for duty’ which could result in flight cancellations. Although the Anaheim Hilton is about 30 minutes closer to the airport than previous accommodation, unions insist the hotel is too noisy for airline staff . A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that they observe rigid protocols in relation to the amount of rest staff must get and it is always in the best interest of the airline to ensure these requirements are met. She said Qantas often 'go above and beyond' the regulatory rest requirements to ensure the 'wellbeing' of flight crew. In response to recent allegations that staff are being mistreated she said  the airline uses 'number of different hotels in LA', which are not limited to the Anaheim Hilton. A Qantas spokeswoman said ensuring its staff's well being is of the utmost importance . The spokeswoman said Qantas are trying to resolve the issue by collaborating with the hotel to better organise accommodation around scheduled music events that may cause concern for staff. A spokeswoman from the Aneheim Hilton said the noise heard from the convention centre is minimal, however, if there are events held in the courtyard the noise can be louder. She added that noise complaints are few and far between because of noise restrictions that are put into place at 10pm each night to ensure guests are not effected. Daily Mail Australia contacted Flight Attendant Association Australia however they were unavailable for comment.

Karen was not eligible for treatment on the NHS, so in June 2009 she booked in for gastric band surgery at the private Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham for £5,000. She said: 'After the surgery, my stomach was so small I was on a liquid diet for six weeks and then tiny portions.'

She said: 'Seeing that problems can happen at home too, Darren agreed to me going abroad again.' In April 2013, she headed back to Prague for breast augmentation, uplift and corrective surgery to her thighs. Karen, pictured before the surgery, began with an upper arm lift . Mr Smith was concerned about the safety of the clinic so she opted to start with a simple procedure, an upper arm lift, at the Beauty in Prague Clinic in the Czech Republic (pictured: after the treatment) Karen’s breasts were boosted from a AA to a DD and liposuction on her knees and thighs gave her the 'shapely pins' she had dreamed of.

The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs. The industry trade group released the survey Thursday at the Global Pet Expo, an annual trade show in Orlando, Florida. The data came from a variety of groups, market research studies and media reports. The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs . Here's a snapshot of how we spend money on pets: . WHERE THE MONEY GOES . The association measures five areas of spending. Last year, people spent $22 billion on food; $15 billion on veterinary care; $14 billion on supplies such as beds, bowls and collars and over-the-counter medicine to fight ailments such as fleas, ticks and colds; $4.8 billion on other services; and $2 billion on animals themselves. The 'other services' category grew the fastest in 2014 and includes payments on grooming, boarding, walking, training, day care and even trips to the spa — where pets can get facials and massages, said Bob Vetere, president and CEO of the pet products association, based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Food:  $22.62 billion . Supplies/OTC Medicine: $13.72 billion . Vet Care:  $15.25 billion . Live animal purchases:  $2.19 billion . Grooming & boarding: $4.73 billion . The breakdown of pet expenses above is an estimation by the American Pet Products Association based on its annual report on pet industry . VET VISITS FLAT . The report says trips to the veterinarian were unchanged or slightly down last year, although expenditures per visit have increased as owners green-light more expensive procedures, Vetere said. Those treatments ranged from the lifesaving to the exotic, like plastic surgery. A robust human-animal bond still exists, especially with dogs and cats, and people are doing more to prolong their pets' lives, from surgery to food, Vetere said. WHAT'S FOR DINNER . If food for pets sometimes sounds good enough to eat, it's because it is. San Diego-based Honest Kitchen and Vero Beach, Florida-based Caru Natural Dog Stews are two pet food brands considered human-grade by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because their grub is made with ingredients palatable by people and produced in facilities meeting higher safety requirements. Americans spent the most on food for their pets last year, and much of it mirrored human trends, such as gluten-free, wheat-free, little sugar or reduced-calorie. The feast might come dry, wet, raw, baked, flaked, shredded, diced, sliced, frozen or freeze-dried. PET SALES DOWN . Sales of the animals themselves dropped from $2.23 billion in 2013 to $2.15 billion in 2014, which was expected because spending in the category has fallen slightly each of the past several years, Vetere said. There is likely no one reason, he said. But adoptions at shelters and rescues are strong, many cities banned the sale of dogs from puppy mills and the lifespans of dogs and cats have lengthened. INDUSTRY GROWTH . As pets have become more important parts of U.S. families, spending on them has exploded. There has been more than a threefold increase since the group's first survey was released in 1994, when people paid out $17 billion. Spending grew 4.2 percent, from $55.72 billion in 2013 to $58.04 billion last year, Vetere said. COMPARING SPENDING . People spent about five times more on their pets than they did on movies last year. The box office firm Rentrak estimated that ticket sales from 2014 totaled $10.4 billion, a 5.2 percent drop from 2013. But people spent far more on their homes than they did their pets, with expenditures from home improvements and repairs reaching $298 billion in 2013, the most recent data available.

Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities once the US fully lifts its ban on trade and travel. It’s in villages such as Gabriel where visitors can experience a side of the Caribbean island that few holidaymakers bother to see. Scroll down for video . People linger outside a residence, where meat is sold at a roadside stand, in the rural village of Gabriel, Cuba . Cuba's rural communities, where there are few jobs, could benefit the most from thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments . Like in Havana, posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere in the village of Gabriel . A salesman waits for customers at his roadside stand, where customers can buy fresh vegetables and fruit from a local farm . In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and – just like in the capital of Havana – posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere. While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba’s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities . It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity . In Gabriel, Cuba, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, and goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor . The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961 . While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers. Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets. With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'. Rural villages are not prepared to handle foreign tourists in large numbers, as there are very few modern facilities . With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April . Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture . In rural Cuba, villagers make a living by selling vegetables, fruit and meat from local farms . The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year . While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain . One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed . Tourists on a double-decker bus take in the sights, including a local football match, during a tour of Havana, Cuba's capital . If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games . 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries’ shared love of baseball. Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power. Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and ‘50s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In village of Gabriel, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, and there are very few cars .\nLike in Havana, paintings or posters of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere .\nUS and Cuban government officials continue to hold talks to end half-century diplomatic freeze ."}]}

The Prime Minister pledged to ‘keep backing’ Margaret Thatcher’s flagship Right To Buy policy, and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves. His comments follow speculation that the Tories want to extend the policy, perhaps by including 2.5million housing association tenants. Harsh words: David Cameron has pledged to ‘keep backing’ the Right To Buy policy, and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith also wants to reward social housing tenants who hold down a job for a year or more with an automatic stake in their properties. In a pre-election rally in Essex, Mr Cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘country man’. And he claimed that a Labour government would result in higher borrowing costs; pushing up mortgage cost for families by an extra £1,000 a year. Last night a poll found that the Conservatives have taken the lead over Labour – and that voters believe Britain would be burdened with more debt if Ed Miliband wins office. Polling from Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory Party deputy chairman, found that the Conservatives had opened up a two-point lead over Labour. In a pre-election rally in Essex, Mr Cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘country man’ It also found three times as many people believe a Labour government will result in more borrowing and debt than if Mr Cameron remained in office. Speaking at a property firm in Colchester yesterday, the Prime Minister said: ‘We will give more people the chance to own their home by backing the Right to Buy, and more security for those who rent. ‘Right to Buy is one of the greatest Conservative ideas of the last century – because it’s about pure, undiluted aspiration. ‘As Conservatives we don’t believe that people’s circumstances need to be stuck in one place forever. If you’re out of work – you don’t have to stay out of work. ‘If you’re in poverty – you don’t have to stay in poverty. If you had a difficult start in life – you don’t have to repeat the same patterns you were born into. All these things can be overcome with the right opportunities. ‘And that is what Right to Buy is about – people’s hard work taking them from being tenants in their home to owners of their home.’ He added that critics of Right to Buy were invariably homeowners themselves. ‘Whatever some social commentators say, people do have a deep desire to own a place of their own,’ he said. ‘And it’s interesting – often the people who criticise Right to Buy, who think it’s unnecessary, are speaking from the comfort and security of a home that they own. Rally: David Cameron applauds a speaker as he prepares to deliver a speech setting out the Conservative Party's sixth manifesto theme at ThinkBDW in Colchester . ‘As Conservatives we don’t think it’s one rule for us and one rule for them. We want to give everyone the chance of owning their own home. ‘So we extended Right to Buy. Thirty-three thousand more people have become homeowners this way, and our Conservative commitment for the next Parliament is to keep on backing this scheme.’ Mr Cameron also pledged to protect the green belt if the Conservatives win the next election – saying he wanted his children to walk on unspoilt countryside such as the North Downs. Building must take place on brownfield land as a priority, he said, but he acknowledged that building could not be restricted to such land. He said Britain is on target to build 200,000 homes a year by 2017 – bearing Labour’s target by three years. ‘When it comes to our Green Belt, I have been clear,’ he said. ‘The line remains scored in the sand – that land is precious. I am a country man. I love our countryside. ‘Put simply: the Green Belt is protected with us. And it is not just green belt that concerns people but green fields. I agree.’ The Prime Minister also said that a future Conservative government will ‘keep mortgage rates low’ so that homeowners can ‘go to bed with real peace of mind’. Pledging that maintaining low borrowing costs would be the first priority of the Tories’ housing policy, he attributed the UK’s historically low interest rates of 0.5 per cent to his government’s deficit reduction programme. He said Labour’s plan to borrow for investment would result in higher borrowing costs for home owners. ‘And do you know what that could cost people? Just a one per cent rise in market rates would add £1,000 to the average mortgage bill. ‘Britain’s home owners cannot afford that. So in the next Parliament Conservatives would see through our long-term economic plan, clear the deficit, run a budget surplus by 2018, and help keep mortgage rates low.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David Cameron pledged to ‘keep backing’ Right To Buy policy .\nCalled critics hypocrites as they're usually homeowners themselves .\nPM's speech follow speculation that Tories want to extend the policy ."}]}

Labour reacted with fury when the broadcasters announced – after weeks of wrangling – that neither David Cameron nor Nick Clegg would be invited to the second debate on April 16. Only the non-governing parties will feature, meaning Mr Miliband will appear with the leaders of Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. David Cameron will only appear in one full debate, hosted by ITV on Thursday, April 2, with the six other party leaders . Ed Miliband will have to line up with the minnow parties on a ‘night of the non-entities’ because neither David Cameron nor Nick Clegg will be invited to the second debate on April 16 . Mr Clegg’s absence means that Mr Miliband will not be able to accuse Mr Cameron of being ‘chicken’ by avoiding the exchange, or force the broadcasters to ‘empty chair’ the Prime Minister. No10 has also successfully killed the idea of a direct head-to-head debate between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband. The two men will instead join Mr Clegg in making individual appearances in front of a studio audience for a BBC Question Time special. It means that Mr Cameron will only appear in one full debate, hosted by ITV on Thursday, April 2, with the six other party leaders. The announcement of the broadcasters’ final plans represents a triumph for Downing Street strategists, who did not want the Election campaign to be dominated by the debates, as it was in 2010, on the grounds that Mr Miliband’s stock is already so low with the public he had the least to lose. But the Lib Dems have described the final arrangements as a ‘farce’. And Labour issued an angry statement accusing the broadcasters of reneging on a commitment to proceed with the head-to-head debate programme after ‘weeks of pressure from the Conservative Party’, insisting that the ‘cowardice’ of Mr Cameron had thwarted the head-to-head encounter. Labour also claimed that Mr Clegg had been excluded from the April 16 debate ‘at the Conservative Party’s insistence’ to provide cover for the PM’s absence. Labour has claimed that Nick Clegg (pictured) had been excluded from the April 16 debate ‘at the Conservative Party’s insistence’ to provide cover for the PM’s absence . Ukip leader Nigel Farage areacted angrily, saying TV debates were now 'so far from the original proposals' A Labour spokesman said: ‘The whole country will understand the reasons for this: the Prime Minister wants to minimise the scope of televised debates between himself and Ed Miliband. ‘We hope that even at this late stage David Cameron will rethink his decision not to take part on April 16. ‘The Prime Minister’s repeated attempts to dictate the abandonment of these TV programmes to independent broadcasters is deeply worrying.’ The spokesman added that after the Election Labour would seek to put future debate programmes on a statutory footing. Ukip leader Nigel Farage also reacted angrily, saying: ‘TV debates are now so far from the original proposals. Broadcasters should be ashamed. They’ve kow-towed to manipulation from Downing Street.’ In a joint statement, the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 said: ‘We’re delighted there will be a debate with all the party leaders during the campaign. The debate on April 2 will build on the success of the 2010 TV debates so valued by viewers.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘If it was down to us, we would be in every TV debate. But the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and need to get on with it. Frankly this is all a farce’.

Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said.

Jessica Ainscough, 30, passed away last week after a long battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma, which she chose to fight with natural and often controversial methods. When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she tried conventional treatments but when her cancer resurfaced she opted instead for a natural treatment called Gerson Therapy which involves drinking raw juices and coffee enemas. Ms Ainscough's family spoke out about online backlash she faced as a result of her views on alternative medicine in a statement published in the Queensland Times - saying that when her cancer returned in 2014 she again tried conventional treatment but it did not help. Scroll down for video . Popular Australian blogger Jessica Ainscough, the 'Wellness Warrior', has died of cancer at the age of 30 . 'It has been speculated by people who have never met or treated Jess that, had she chosen to amputate her arm or undergo further conventional treatment, her chances of survival would have increased,' they said. 'Her treating oncologists do not agree with this uninformed view.' Ms Ainscough was cremated in a private ceremony on Monday, and her public memorial will be held Lifepointe Baptist Church, at Buderim on the Sunshine Coast, at 10am on Friday. Her family have requested donations be made to animal rescue group Edgar's Mission in lieu of flowers. Ms Ainscough's father Col Ainscough said the family was deeply appreciative of the love and support coming in from around the world. 'I'm so proud of my beautiful daughter for her achievements, style, grace, sincerity and affection. I'm devastated although comforted to know that she is now reunited with my wife, Sharyn,' Mr Ainscough said. Her partner Tallon Pamenter said his heart was broken. 'But I feel incredibly blessed to have experienced a love and connection few are lucky enough to have,' Mr Pamenter said. 'Jess and I shared the highest of highs and lowest of lows, and because of this we developed a love so deep that I will forever be grateful for.' Ms Ainscough adopted a strict vegan diet, and additional supplements to 'heal' her body without chemotherapy. Ms Ainscough's mother was diagnosed with cancer, and after embracing Gerson therapy, died in 2013 . Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, 'The Wellness Warrior' 'I didn't chop off my arm. I didn't go into aggressive, full-body chemotherapy. I didn't accept that my doctor's 'solution' was the only course of action,' she wrote on her Wellness Warrior blog. 'I decided that I would do everything in my power to thrive in life, in spite of the looming expiration date I'd been given. I learned how to treat myself with absolute kindness & self-respect. I radicalised my diet. I systematically detoxified my body — and mind.' Ms Ainscough's approach has no scientific support but has garnered enthusiastic adoption from a small proportion of cancer sufferers around the world. 'Somewhere along the way, I realised that I was more than a 'cancer story' — I was a leader, a role model, an educator, and a champion,' she wrote on her blog. 'Part of an empowering wellness revolution, sweeping the planet. Someone who could change lives & provide HOPE — simply by showing up, and telling my story.' Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, attracting thousands of followers on social media and publishing a book called 'Make Peace with Your Plate'. When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she refused conventional treatment . Her unusual approach to fighting cancer attracted significant criticism from the public, and bodies such as the Cancer Council. 'The data that are available are not sufficient to warrant claims that the Gerson therapy is effective as an adjuvant to other cancer therapies or as a cure,' a page on the Cancer Council's website says. 'At this time, the use of the Gerson therapy in the treatment of cancer patients cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed clinical trials.' Her mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by Ms Ainscough's success, also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. 'I've been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before. After my mum died at the end of last year, my heart was shattered and it's still in a million pieces,' she wrote on her blog in December last year. 'I had no idea how to function without her, and it turns out my body didn't either. For the first time in my almost seven year journey with cancer, this year I've been really unwell,' she wrote. 'I've been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before,' said Ms Ainscough on her blog . Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January . 'I've lived with cancer since 2008 and for most of those years my condition was totally stable. When my mum became really ill, my cancer started to become aggressive again. After she died, things really started flaring up.' Ms Ainscough reportedly began pursuing conventional treatments after she suffered through ten months of constant bleeding from the tumours in her arm and shoulder. 'This has been a game-changer for me and also very strange. Some weeks I've felt nothing but overwhelming sadness, others I've been really bitter and angry,' she wrote. 'I've also spent my time doing lots of research into treatment options. I've been speaking to doctors, healers, and specialists and I've been completely opening myself up to attracting the right people who will help me heal – whether they are from the natural medicine world or conventional,' 'My beliefs have been completely shaken up and I've had to drop any remnants of fear and ego that were preventing me from exploring these options sooner.' Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January. Her website now features a photograph of Ms Ainscough, with the memorium 'On February 26th, 2015, the world lost one of its brightest sparks'. 'After 30 years, seven of which were spent thriving with cancer, Jess Ainscough peacefully passed away.'

Johnson, pictured with his girlfriend, was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl . The gates at Johnson's £1.8million mansion were shut following his arrest earlier this month . And the club said in a statement: ‘Following the decision by the police today (Tuesday), the club will be reviewing its position and will not make any further comment at the present time.’ Johnson has missed their last two matches but could now be available to new boss Dick Advocaat if the club decide to lift the player’s suspension. Sportsmail reported on Tuesday that Johnson has been training at home with a fitness coach in the hope that the case would be dropped. Meanwhile, Durham Constabulary issued a warning to those using social media that identifying the alleged victim is a criminal offence. A spokesman said: ‘Durham Constabulary is aware this investigation has resulted in considerable rumour and speculation, much of it on social media and in relation to the victim. Former Manchester City man Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson played 81 minutes of Sunderland's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United shortly before being arrested . ‘This has caused distress to the victim and her family and is very unhelpful while we still have a number of actions to carry out as part of our enquiries. ‘We stress again the warning we have already given, that anyone who publishes anything which may identify the victim of a sexual offence is committing a criminal act and will be dealt with accordingly. ‘At the time of the man’s arrest, media reports suggested a weapon had been recovered from the house. This has now been fully examined and confirmed to be an item which does not require a firearms certificate, therefore no further police action will follow.’ Johnson, pictured playing against Switzerland in 2011, has 12 England caps to his name .

Cars have been brought to a hasty halt after a unique animal crossing of a hopping kind. A group of over 20 kangaroos have made a quick dash across the Craigieburn East Road in Victoria on Thursday morning. At 10.50 am on Thursday, many cars were brought to a hasty halt as over 20 kangaroos crossed the highway . The swarm executed perfect timing with the cars able to safely slow down and watch the group . The video shows the troop hopping across the busy road in single file and jumping over a barbed-wire fence to make it to the land on the other side. All caught on a driver's Dash Cam, some of the animals are seen to be doing flips over the fence and disappearing into the long grass. Luckily all other cars slow to a halt on the 100km/hr road to wait for the group to safely cross, with all cautiously driving off after the encounter. With no clear 'kangaroo crossing' signage the confrontation could have been potentially dangerous. Kangaroo crossings are more dangerous at night as the animals become blinded by vehicle head lights . Some of the kangaroos can be seen performing expert flips over the barbed wire fence and disappear into the grass . The crossing took place at 10.50 am on a Thursday and there were clearly not too many vehicles on the usually busy road. The Craigieburn East Road is 45 minutes north of Melbourne and the driver was on his way to work. In the day, our hopping friends are more likely to make a safer crossing by choosing their moments to dash more wisely. However in the evenings, when they are most active, they are easily collected as they become blinded by the headlights of cars."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A troop of over 20 kangaroos have been captured on video .\nThe group were crossing the Craigieburn East Road on Thursday morning .\nDriver's Dash Cam captured the action with all the cars slowing to a halt .\nSome of the kangaroos can be seen to be doing flips over the fence ."}]}

Special: Little Hanru van Niekerk was born with a birthmark shaped like the number 12 on his forehead . Cute: The family of the little boy, who lives in Johannesburg in South Africa, spotted the markings soon after he was born on November 11 2014 . Doctors have reassured the family of the boy, now four months old, that the markings will gradually fade with time. Great grandmother Catherine Jooste told the Northcliff Melville TImes that they have embraced the peculiar birthmark, which was a 'beautiful surprise'. She said: 'My youngest daughter was the first one to see it and she said there is a 1 and a 2 on his forehead. 'We did not worry about it, his doctor said it will fade as he gets older.' According to NHS Choices, birthmarks come in two main categories, vascular or pigmented. Vascular birthmarks tend to occur in the head or neck area, being caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, which can fade after a few months. In comparison, pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured, caused by a cluster of pigment cells.

The annual luncheon event is set to be held at the exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane on Friday. The oldest and most prestigious membership club in Brisbane boasts that those who wish to sign up will enjoy unlimited possibilities, luxury services and the opportunity to join 'an influential network of like-minded members'. But if you aren't a man, you need to be a relative or friend of a member to be privileged enough to walk through the door and relish in these perks. The exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane is the ironic venue of choice for the International Women's Day event hosted by the Liberal National Party on Friday . An LNP spokesman said the venue was chosen due to availability, price and flexibility and location. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asked Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is also the Federal Minister for Women, to comment on the topic during Question Time at Parliament House on Wednesday. Mr Abbott replied that the venue choice should be deemed as a positive move - saying the last sexism barrier had been broken down. 'Admit women! Isn't that fantastic? At last, this bastion of chauvinism has admitted women and they've done it on International Women's Day because of the Liberal National Party, Fairfax reported him as saying. Prime Minister and Minister for Women Tony Abbott looking very smug after saying the venue choice was a sign that his party is 'smashing the glass ceiling yet again' 'Good on the Liberal National Party, smashing the glass ceiling yet again.' 'I say congratulations and thank God that bastion of old-fashioned chauvinism has finally collapsed like the walls of Jericho at the trumpet cry of the Liberal National Party,' he said . Parliamentary Speaker Fiona Simpson, who is the keynote speaker at the luncheon, did not seem bothered by the event being held at a club where women aren't allowed to join. 'I'm less troubled by openly 'male only' clubs or openly 'women only' gyms than I am by areas of society that have a veneer of equality but which hide structural impediments or unconscious bias that block women from opportunities,' she said told the Brisbane Times.

Silva and his team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and head into the game having been written off by just about everybody. However, the Spanish international believes Manuel Pellegrini's team can progress if they manage to become only the fifth team — and the first in the competition — to stop Luis Enrique's team scoring. Manchester City playmaker David Silva believes they have to stop Barcelona scoring to have a chance . Silva and his City team-mates are 2-1 down after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie . It is a task easier said than done to stop Barcelona, led by Lionel Messi, from scoring at home . Messi (centre) and co will have something to say about City's progress when the come to the Nou Camp . 'We need the kind of mentality we showed in the games against Roma and Bayern Munich in the group stages,' Silva said. 'The most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult. 'Strange things can happen. Everybody wrote Schalke off before they played Real Madrid but they won 4-3 and could have scored again which would have put them through. Nobody predicted that. 'Not many thought PSG could beat Chelsea, especially with only 10 men for so long, so I know that everything can happen, not only in the Champions League but in every game. 'Everyone is expecting Barca to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we don't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away.' Silva is preparing to face Barcelona with his City team-mates on Wednesday night at the Nou Camp . Silva feels City can progress if they can stop Barcelona from scoring against them in the last-16 tie . City travelled to Spain at this stage last season, having lost the home leg 2-0. This time they are slightly better off following Joe Hart's last-minute penalty save from Lionel Messi at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago. 'We played well in the second leg against Barca last season and played with freedom so we will see,' added Silva. Revered in Spain, where he played for first Celta Vigo and then Valencia, Silva has long been coveted by Barcelona and indeed Real Madrid. The 29-year-old has insisted, however, that he isn't thinking about a move away from City and has enjoyed playing further up the field under Manuel Pellegrini this season. 'I have played closer to the box in a more advanced position this season and that's why I'm scoring goals,' he said. Manuel Pellegrini will look to perform a miracle on Wednesday night against a powerful Barcelona side . 'It's more about the team than individuals. If we are good as a group we can make the difference. I always have freedom in the pitch but now we need all the players at their best if we are to go through . 'I have four more years on my contract and I'm very happy here — I have always said that. The way the supporters are with me is something I'm very proud of and it inspires me to play my best and I'm humbled to have that kind of appreciation every time I play.'

The remarkable collection, which also includes memorabilia belonging to the pair including reading glasses, a comb and a pen-set, has been revealed in full for the first time. It is owned by Andy Jones - who runs a museum in a converted jail in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire – and gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the East End mobsters. Mr Jones, 53, was left all of the items by Reggie after he struck up a friendship with him when visiting him in prison. Scroll down for video . The remarkable collection of memorabilia, including a shotgun (pictured), of Ronnie and Reggie Kray, which is kept in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, by owner Andy Jones, has been revealed in full for the first time . The collection, including Ronnie's crossbow (pictured) gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the Krays . Ronnie Kray's knuckleduster also features in the collection which has been photographed by Peter Dazeley . Reggie Kray's penknife is also part of the collection which has been released ahead of a film about the twins . One interesting piece of memorabilia in the collection is a letter from Violet Kray to a friend (pictured) in which she describes her sons Ronnie and Reggie as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet' As well as the weapons, the collection also features a letter sent from Ronnie and Reggie's mother Violet to a friend, in which describes her sons as 'the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet.' The items have been photographed comprehensively for the first time by renowned photographer Peter Dazeley, ahead of the release of a film about the Kray twins which will star actor Tom Hardy and is due to be released later this year. Mr Dazeley, from London, said: 'The brothers were among the last prisoners to be held in the Tower of London in 1952, for failing to report for National Service. 'They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and the murders of George Cornell in the Blind Beggar Pub in Whitechapel and Jack 'the Hat' McVitie. 'They were arrested on May 9, 1968, and convicted of the murders at the Old Bailey in 1969, by the efforts of a squad of detectives led by detective superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read of the Yard. 'About 60 plain-clothed policemen kept a 24-hour watch on the jury throughout the trial, following them home from court and even into public houses. 'The brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders, the longest sentences ever passed at the Old Bailey. 'Their memorabilia is from the private collection of Andy Jones, of the Littledean Jail, and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at Her Majesty's pleasure.' Ronnie and Reggie Kray (pictured) were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in Bethnal Green, east London. The mobsters quickly certified themselves as the most 'notorious' brothers in the East End gangland . The private collection has been photographed in full for the first time. Pictured: Ronnie's sawn-off shotgun . One of the Krays owned a catapult (pictured) which presumably he used during altercations in the East End . Mr Dazeley said: 'Their memorabilia is from the private collection of Andy Jones, of the Littledean Jail, and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at Her Majesty's pleasure.' Pictured: Ronnie's pen-set . Experts said the collection of weaponry and personal items shows the two different sides of the Kray twins. Pictured: Ronnie's draughts set is one of the items which has been photographed by Londoner Peter Dazeley . A hair comb belonging to one of the brothers, who have both since died, is also part of the private collection . Mr Dazeley said the memorabilia showed the different sides to the Kray twins, who have now both died. He said: 'The low level of weaponry is extraordinary by today's standards. There's a pellet gun, crossbow and what looks like a child's catapult. 'Some of the items are somewhat more serious like Reggie's bayonet and knife, but then there is also his artist's paint set. 'These really are the personal effects of the twins. Amongst Ronnie's objects there is his cigarette case, comb and draught set as well as a sawn-off shotgun. 'And then again showing another side there's his pen and his infamous glasses. 'Also in a letter from their mother to a friend discussing her sons, she mentions that they 'are the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet and they have never hurt anyone only their own kind.' The twins were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in Bethnal Green, east London. During adulthood, the pair quickly certified themselves as the most 'notorious' brothers in the East End gangland. Ronnie was eventually certified insane and lived the remainder of his life in Broadmoor Hospital, where he died on March 17, 1995, of a heart attack at the age of 61. Reggie was freed on compassionate grounds with inoperable cancer on August 26, 2000, when he was almost 67, and died in his sleep on October 1, 2000.

He told MailOnline: 'I used to visit Reggie in prison before he died and I’ve had them for a number of years. They were gifted to me after a visit to see him at Maidstone Prison. 'I became friendly with him and he basically donated quite a number of items for display at what we call the \"Crime Through Time\" collection at Littledean.' Mr Jones said the pair became friendly after Kray contacted him with a view to donating some of his items. He said: 'He contacted me with a view to introducing himself and a number of other notorious gangland figures who have since donated a number of items for display at the museum. 'I visited him several times in prison in the 1990s. He was very, very quiet, a gentleman. 'He was able to provide me with a lot of other contacts who have been able to donate to the prison including Charles Bronson, Charlie Richardson, Freddie Foreman and many notorious villains.' Mr Jones said the items will go on display for the first time when the museum reopens for the season on March 28. He added: 'These items will all be on display along with many other personal artifacts from the Krays and their many acquaintances, both from the criminal underworld and friends from their celebrity circles. 'It’s the biggest private collection of Kray memorabilia on display to the public.' He added that the museum is a 'very controversial and politically incorrect museum' and said it's 'not everyone’s cup of tea'. The Krays were almost born into a life of crime. Their father, Charlie senior, was hardly the ideal role model. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was called up to join the Army, but deserted. Frequently away from home and up to no good, the twins probably saw more of the police, who kept visiting their house at 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green, than they did their father. It was up to their mother, Violet, to keep the family together, which was a struggle. From left to right: Reggie, Charlie and Ronnie Kray outside their home in Bethnal Green, east London . For a while, her three sons stayed out of trouble, and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring, where the twins would win many a competition. However, by their late teens, Ronnie and Reggie were also fighting on the streets, and they soon started their own gang. When they turned 18 in 1951, they decided that military service was not for them. They spent most of their National Service in the guardroom. Matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen, and were imprisoned in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Upon their return to the East End, it was clear they would never settle into regular lives. Their first business venture was a club called the Regal, off the Mile End Road, which looked like a dive from the outside but which the Krays turned into a glamorous, fashionable nightspot. Ronnie and Reggie Kray pictured in the 1960s . In their sharp suits, they did their best to maintain, publicly at least, a veneer of respectability, but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable, from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder. Of the two siblings, Ronnie was considered the more dangerous. He was imprisoned in 1957 for GBH. While locked up, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, which partly explained his violent tendencies. Unusually for that time, Ronnie was also publicly bisexual, which Reggie found difficult to accept. Despite Reggie also being jailed in 1959, the Krays' 'business' activities went from strength to strength, and by the Sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as Barbara Windsor, and eminent politicians such as Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie is likely to have had an affair. Ronnie remained unmarried, and Reggie's marriage to Frances Shea in 1965 only lasted for eight months. She died in 1967. It is thought that she committed suicide, although according to one account, Frances was murdered by Ronnie, for reasons that are unclear. In the middle of 1968, the twins’ older brother Charlie were arrested for murder. Ronnie had shot a rival gang member called George Cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub, and Reggie, normally the 'gentle' one, had repeatedly stabbed gang member Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in the face and neck for not following orders. Both men were given life sentences, with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years. Charlie was sent down for ten years, for being an accessory to the murder of McVitie. Ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and Reggie died in 2000 aged 66.

A Texas fraternity at the Southern Methodist University has suspended eight members for terrorizing their neighbors. Security footage of rowdy Sigma Chi brothers filmed by Tim O'Connell, 42, reveals how they would urinate on his fence, write obscenities into the snow on his yard, spit on his house and throw raw meat onto his patio. Just like the Hollywood movie Neighbors, starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, the dispute began when O'Connell and his wife complained about the noise from the off-campus students, who lived in an upmarket home near to SMU. 'I brought it to their attention and said 'you can't do that.' They told me they pay rent and they can do whatever they want. It's their right,' O'Connell recounted to News 8. In a statement to address the behavior of their members, the Sigma Chi fraternity said that hopefully now the O'Connell's will be able to sleep better. 'The apology is just the first step in making amends to you for the tenants' actions. I am also working on various forms of punishment for the culprits,' wrote Steve Harrington, Sigma Chi chapter advisor, in an e-mail to O'Connell that was shared with News 8. Appalled by the actions of their neighbors, O'Connell and his wife set up a camera and caught the young men next door violating their property and hurling abuse their way. Warring: Tim O'Connell claims his life was made a misery living next door to Sigma Chi brothers who lived in the house on the right, while O'Connell lived in the house on the left . Like a movie: Tim O'Connell's experience was reminiscent of the Zac Efron and Seth Rogen comedy 'Neighbors' which featured a married couple battling a party-loving fraternity . O'Connell told News 8 the disgusting behavior escalated after he complained about their noise. In response to viewing the footage of their members urinating on O'Connells fence and writing f*** you into the snow on their front lawn, the fraternity have said they will also fine the members. 'I want to make this a learning opportunity for these men,' Harrington wrote in the e-mail to O'Connell. 'I believe that community service and charitable work and/or donations would show them a way to get out of themselves. I believe that being young and self-centered is the main contributor to the behavior they displayed, showing no regard for others. We need to teach them otherwise.' O'Connell claims he asked SMU for help before, but got no response. According to News 8 an investment firm is the owner of the the home and they admitted that O'Connell has had problems with the tennents before.

These are just some of the foods and drinks you need to be incorporating into your post-exercise diet. And try to eat within an hour of finishing your workout as that's when your body needs it most as it  starts to burn food as well as recover. What you eat after a workout can increase the benefits of exercise . 'What you eat post workout is extremely important. The aim of a healthy post workout snack/meal is to improve recovery, reduce muscle soreness, increase the ability to build muscle and to help with your immune system,' said Shona Wilkinson, head nutritionist at NutriCentre. 'It is best to eat your food within one hour after you finish your exercise. Waiting too long will mean that you don't refill your glycogen stores and wont recover fully,' she continued. According to Ms Wilkinson, the perfect post workout snack or meal consists of both carbs and protein. Good examples include wholewheat muffins with nut butter, scrambled eggs on whole wheat toast and chicken breast with brown rice or quinoa. Try swapping quinoa (left)  for rice when cooking a post-gym meal. Hummus and pita (right) are good snacks as they contain carbohydrates and protein . A good source of protein and fibre, quinoa gets the thumbs of from Ms Wilkinson. 'This is a great food to have after a workout to ensure you are getting a good intake of nutrients,' she explained. The nutrionist also explained what kefir is, and why it's good for you. 'Kefir results when milk is combined with bacteria and allowed to ferment,' she said. 'It is high in protein and will help with the recovery of your muscles.' Wholewheat pitta and hummus can provide much needed carbs and protein whilst pineapple, rich in an enzyme called bromelain, is useful for preventing injuries. You can still indulge in a plate of fish and chips; just make sure that you have oily fish instead of cod or hake . Steak contains zinc which is critical to prostate health and fertility, and iron which is a key component of oxygen delivery within your cells . Starchy vegetables such as sweet potato can be eaten hot or cold green vegetables such as broccoli, kale and beans help alkalise the body. And while fried fish and chips may not necessarily sound healthy, swapping oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies for cod and hake, will improve body fat burning. Finally steak, which contains zinc as well as protein, helps deliver oxygen to cells. Here FEMAIL has identified the foods you need to incorporate into your diet to ensure your body recovers well from a workout. Quinoa . Quiona is a great alternative to rice.

You can drink a cup of kefir after a workout for a healthy way to get a good healthy intake of protein to help with the repair and recovery of your muscles.' Pita and hummus . 'Pitta and hummus is a great combination for a post workout snack,' the nutrionist advised. 'Go for wholewheat pita rather than white pita. Hummus is a good source of protein and carbs. The wholewheat pita is a good source of slow releasing carbs to keep your energy levels up. Sweet potato (left) is a nutritionally dense carb whilst green vegetables (right) will help prevent fatigue . Fermented milk kefir is high in protein and will help with muscle recovery . Pineapple . Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain. Bromelain helps with digesting protein and is a helpful anti-inflammatory which is useful for preventing injuries. Pineapple also contains fibre, vitamin B6, manganese and is a great source of Vitamin C. Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme. Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training.

Coach Peter Moores' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which England were rarely competitive, losing four of their five games, to crash out of the tournament with Friday's final group game against Afghanistan still to play. Downton has the power in his hands to end Moores' second spell in charge but in the wake of Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh he has so far sought to back the man he described as 'the outstanding coach of his generation' when he appointed him last April. Peter Moores' place as England coach is safe in the short-term, says ECB managing director Paul Downton . Eoin Morgan's position as captain is in question after England's early exit from the World Cup . It is high praise that Downton still believes Moores is worthy despite an unconvincing record, albeit with a remodelled team, soured further by events over the past month. 'As far as his ability is concerned I still feel he is a very high-quality coach, so, no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago,' Downton said. Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place . 'You don't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen.' England fly out to the Caribbean for a Test series early next month and while it appears any fall-out from the ECB review is unlikely to strike before then, Downton did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that Moores would remain in charge. 'All I have said is that we're still within the first year of his appointment,' he said. 'We clearly will have a major review of what's happened in the last six months but particularly during the World Cup. 'Everybody is extremely raw from yesterday's experience but we still have a game left in the World Cup, so no decisions are going to be made in the short term. 'In less than a month we will be in the West Indies playing Test cricket so I don't envisage any short-term changes.' The upcoming review could also leave Downton to feel at some unease. The 57-year-old was not employed by incoming chairman Colin Graves or Tom Harrison, who was appointed as the ECB's chief executive officer last October. Downton will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as Monday while England's tournament-ending defeat was ongoing in Adelaide. 'I've worked with Colin Graves on the board for the last year. He's been extremely supportive of everything we've done,' he said. Bangladesh players celebrates after their victory over England that eliminated Morgan's side from the Cup . Downton says incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who did not appoint him, has been supportive . 'Tom has been with us for two months and we've spent a lot of time together. Both have been extremely supportive in what we're doing.' England fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter's Ashes whitewash and Moores was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of Jonathan Trott, Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen following his well-publicised falling out with the ECB. The former Lancashire coach has attempted to bring young players through and England's performances immediately suffered as they succumbed to a first-ever home Test series defeat to Sri Lanka. They bounced back strongly to beat India after falling behind in that series, but since then England have struggled in the one-day arena, losing 18 of 27 games under Moores, and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the World Cup. 'We're in the middle of a very significant rebuilding phase,' Downton said. 'We offered six new central contracts during the summer. My first job when I came in here was to try to re-establish a Test side which we made progress with in the summer. 'The next job was to get to the World Cup with as competitive a side as we could. We always knew we coming from behind. England vice-captain looks dejected after top-scoring with 65 in their loss to Bangladesh on Monday . Moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target . 'All I will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation. Look through history, look at any very successful side which has broken up, how long it takes sometimes to rebuild again. 'I am very confident that in a year's time, in two years' time this group of players will be battle-hardened and will be more competitive.' While one-day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months, when England will embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests, the ECB will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the World Cup comes to these shores in 2019. England's senior players are set to be consulted and Downton suggested the possibility of a specific selector for ODIs would be discussed. Meanwhile, all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali are fitness doubts for the match against Afghanistan after they both suffered injuries in the defeat to Bangladesh. Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with his left foot in a protective boot after feeling pain during his late bid to save England's World Cup while Moeen suffered side injury while bowling.

The police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party. The accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the Rolling Stone article. After the account was published last fall, Rolling Stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details. CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter described Rolling Stone's announcement as falling short of a full-scale retraction. It remains unclear what really happened to the female student, Stelter said. \"We are in the phase here where Rolling Stone is trying to figure that out,\" Stelter said in December. \"They've apologized, but not retracted. So they're not saying the story is false. They're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still.\" The Charlottesville Police Department will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. ET on Monday. Rolling Stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly \"orchestrated the attack on 'Jackie' (the woman who was the subject of the article) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,\" a decision the magazine said it regretted. \"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,\" Rolling Stone said in December. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that \"the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story.\" University of Virginia pledges zero-tolerance in rape cases . The article chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault. It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN that is proved by email and fraternity records. Warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser's account. For example, the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity, the fraternity house has no side staircase, and there were no pledges at that time of year. Jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on, asking, \"Don't you want to be a brother?\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Melissa Gray and Sara Ganim contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Police will discuss their investigative findings into an alleged rape of a UVA student .\nThe student's allegations have been clouded by controversy ."}]}

These became known as the  Kinfauns Demos or Esher Demos and they feature a number of hits that  eventually made it onto the White Album. They also feature early versions of Paul McCartney's 'Junk', which would later appear on his 1970 solo record  and Lennon's 'Jealous Guy' (then called 'Child of Nature'), which was released on his 1971 album Imagine.

From luxury mansions in the English countryside to a sweeping ranch in Colorado, properties lived in by John, Paul, George and Ringo attract huge interest. But as well as the glamorous abodes, even their humble childhood homes manage to generate excitement among fans. Just weeks ago the Liverpool house where Sir Paul McCartney lived as a child sold in six minutes at auction to an anonymous local buyer for £150,000. The childhood home of Sir Paul McCartney (pictured centre) sold for £150,000 in just six minutes  - and for more than double the average price for a property on the road in the Speke area of Liverpool . The terraced home in Western Avenue, Speke, was where the musician lived with his parents from 1947 until the mid-1950s. In October, a home where George Harrison spent some of his youth - also in Speke - was snapped up at auction by a super fan. Beatles fanatic Jackie Holmes, from London, bought the Liverpool property for £156,000 at the auction which took place at Liverpool's Cavern Club. The property in Upton Green, was home to the musician during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years. A year earlier, John Lennon's childhood home at 9 Newcastle Road in Wavertree, sold at auction for £480,000. In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife were trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch (pictured) As Beatlemania took off, members of the Fab Four were soon seen in upmarket properties around the globe. And in recent years, luxury homes they have occupied have continued to hit the headlines. In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife had put his country estate in Surrey on the market for more than $20million - and that he was also trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch. The ranch, located about 30 minutes outside Aspen in Woody Creek on 15.8 acres, sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River and has three bedrooms, a living room that features vaulted ceilings, exposed wood beams and a neat rock fireplace. Last year a three-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million . The 17th-century Surrey estate sits on 200 acres of land, and was purchased for just $3.1million by Starr in 1999. Last year a three-bedroom flat shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million. The musicians moved into the apartment in Knightsbridge in 1964 - the year of their first world tour.

Prince Harry turned out to support his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas for the opening night  of The Importance Of Being Earnest, pictured (centre, bottom) with other cast members . Cressida, 26, whose acting career has blossomed since she split from Harry last year, charmed the audience with her portrayal of the excitable and eccentric lead character. Wearing a flowing white dress and with her long hair in ringlets, her background as a dancer shone through as she gracefully bounded across the stage with infectious energy. In her tongue-in-cheek profile for the programme she was described as an 'actor, dancer and sky-diving enthusiast who was raised on a marsh by wolves'. It said: 'Accordingly, she has a vast litter of her own cubs which you may spot romping around the theatre later this evening (do not be alarmed, they're both very friendly and very stupid). The fourth-in-line made a low-key entrance but was seen laughing throughout the comedy of manners starring his ex-girlfriend (right) His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate with her career . 'However, Cressida herself is a very clever little wolf, leaving audiences howling with laughter in her London stage debut earlier this year (Tallulah Brown's There's a Monster in the Lake).' The three-night production is being put on by Band of Others, a London-based theatre group which is raising funds for the Action on Addiction charity, which boasts Kate Middleton as a patron. Prince Harry, 30, wearing a dark blue long-sleeved jumper, did not make any attempt to remain incognito as he sat in the circle with a male friend. He was seen in hysterics at Harry Wright's portrayal of the indomitable Lady Bracknell and Harry Elgood's sophisticated depiction of lead character John Worthing. This comes days after the revelation that Prince Harry is planning to leave the Army to continue his mother's legacy with a number of charitable projects during his second 'gap year'. Speaking  about his choice to bring his active military career to an end, he said it was a 'really tough' decision and he was looking forward to starting a new chapter in his life. The three-night production is being put on by Band of Others at the London Oratory (pictured), a Catholic comprehensive which counts Nick Clegg's son as a pupil . The budding actress has bagged a bit part in Tulip Fever (pictured), the forthcoming Judi Dench movie produced by Harvey Weinstein . Earlier today he joined Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the memorial service of triple Olympic gold equestrian Richard Meade. In a statement on his website, Prince Harry said: '[Richard] had huge successes in his career as a competitor but his greatest success was not in his achievements on a horse, but in the way he conducted himself – with generosity to others, genuine interest and a real sense of integrity, always standing up for what was morally right. 'He cared deeply about the sport and gave so much to both the eventing and wider horse world. Thank you for all the wonderfully supportive letters and messages and many apologies for only answering a small number of them so far.' His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate on her career.

Now hungry burger-lovers keen to try his gourmet-influenced meat are travelling from far and wide to buy them. A new six-part Channel 4 programme, Burger Bar to Gourmet Star, put Carl Sampson, 27, under the tutelage of one of the country's top chefs, Daniel Clifford. What happened when the more humble end of the country's dining spectrum met with the higher echelons of British cookery? Top chef Daniel Clifford (left) tutored Carl Sampson (right) prompting him to turn his food van business around . Flipping great: Carl Sampson, 27, has seen his burgers fly off the shelves of his van after appearing in the television programme. Plans are afoot to sell burgers wholesale and even open a restaurant . Previously, Sampson  made a living serving burgers to passing lorry drivers from a lay-by on the A38 near Worcester. By his own admission, the meat he presented, in a plain white bap, might have left burger aficionados running for the hills. His signature dish wasan artery-straining UFO burger, a carnivorous concoction that comprised four burgers, four sausages, eight rashers of bacon and, somewhere in between, eight squares of processed cheese. However, since his brush with the higher echelons of British cookery, word of mouth has seen people travel from all over the country to sample his fast food. He told the Worcestershire News: 'I’ve had people travel from Chester, London and even Lincoln - that’s a 125-mile trip - just to try them.' Chef Daniel Clifford admits he fully expected Sampson to wilt under the pressure and was amazed by the young chef's stoic attitude . His fortunes changed after an intense cookery lesson with respected chef Daniel Clifford of Midsummer House, Cambridge which prompted a culinary epiphany. The results? Hand-pressed 5oz burgers so in demand that Sampson often has to turn people away. So far, the chef admits he's tinkered with his popular new recipe, which includes rump and chuck steak, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce, more than thirty times. Chef Clifford admits the two men were operating in separate universes. 'I’ve never stopped in one of these places in my life', says the chef as he arrives at the burger van in the show in his Audi. Sampson, whose previous experience as a cook amounted to a stint at McDonald's and working at a pub, was thrown into the deep end of the kitchen at  Midsummer House. It was assumed he would falter under the pressure. Instead Sampson thrived on the one-on-one time with the chef and despite plenty of less-than-friendly words aimed in his direction, he saw the short apprenticeship through. Sampson is planning to sell his burgers wholesale after local farm shops flocked to stock them . Before his training at Midsummer House, Carl Sampson served up standard burgers from a below par butcher. Now his new beef patties, which the recipe for has been tweaked no less than 31 times, includes the following: . Rump steak . Chump steak . Herbs and spices including: . cayenne pepper . Worcestershire sauce . After leaving Midsummer House, the married father set about trying to adapt what he'd learned to his own business. He quickly dismissed the fancier dishes but did realise that there was a lot he could do to up the quality for his existing customer base. He kept the price of favourites the same - a bacon sandwich will still set you back £2.70 - but found a butcher selling better quality meat. He cleaned his van within an inch of its life. He says the chance to aspire for more has been 'life-changing'. He told the Times 'It was life-changing for me on a number of levels.' 'It’s made me a better cook for sure, but it’s also made me appreciate what I have at home too.' The sky's the limit for his business plans too. Local farm shops are going to stock them raw and Sampson is planning to sell them wholesale too. A restaurant in Worcester might also be on the cards. Watch this space. Burger Bar to Gourmet Star airs tonight on Channel 4 ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Burger van owner Carl Sampson, 27, transformed his business after working 16-hour days under top chef Daniel Clifford .\nHe now uses a better butcher and has changed his burger recipe 31 times .\nWord has spread and a customer travelled 125 miles to try one .\nSampson is the star of a new Channel 4 show Best Chef, Worst Chef ."}]}

He, a novice in such entanglements, is now negotiating his own future, albeit with the help of a lady lawyer of impeccable and long-standing loyalty to the family. We are told by Mercedes that a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the season is a formality. Hamilton has said he wants to sign it. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win at the season-opening race in Melbourne, Australia  - but is yet to sign a new deal with the team . Hamilton's current Mercedes contract runs out at the end of this season and no new deal has been agreed yet . Yet four months after he won the world championship in Abu Dhabi, there is only one important fact: no deal has been concluded. This is strange. It is literally only an afternoon’s job sorting out the terms of a contract if there is a willingness on both sides to tie it all up. So why the delay? It may be that Hamilton is holding out for the salary he wants. It is not £1million a week he seeks, despite some reports to the contrary. It is probably about €1m – or the piffling matter of £720,000 according to the current exchange rate. Perhaps the two sides will yet come to a mutually agreeable financial arrangement. But, as one of my mentors advised me about the chicanery of the paddock, there is a reason behind everything in Formula One. Mercedes say a new contract is a formality while Hamilton says he wants ti sign, so why the delay? Hamilton celebrates his Australian GP win in front of second-placed Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel . I hope that the delay is because Hamilton is seeking a move to Ferrari. Madness? No. By the end of the season, he hopes to have emulated his hero Ayrton Senna in winning three world titles – the number that most clearly defines a driver’s status in the pantheon. What has he got to lose? Such is Senna’s immortal fame that here in Australia, from where I write this, Senna’s face is still emblazoned on billboards advertising Tag Heuer watches. Never mind that he died in 1994. Before his fatal accident at the San Marino Grand Prix, Senna, as has since become common knowledge, talked to Ferrari about racing for them. I suspect scratching the itch that Senna could not - namely, competing for the sport’s most evocative marque - would mean more to Hamilton than the possibility of clocking up win after win, title after title. He has never been a chaser of records for their own sake. That kind of thing is for Vettel and the birds. Vettel joined Ferrari ahead of the new season after six seasons driving for Red Bull . The German finished third in his first race for the Scuderia in Melbourne eight days ago . However, there is no reason why Ferrari, with their vast resources, could not deliver title-winning cars for him. Then, he would have won championships with three teams, McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. His status would be further embellished. Another tantalising, legend-making prospect is a straight fight in identical machinery between Hamilton and Vettel. Hamilton, like Fernando Alonso, thinks himself a better racer than Vettel, who, so the theory goes, was flattered by his Red Bull car in winning four world titles. By replacing Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, Hamilton could prove what he has always believed. I can hear the chorus of the cautious. Mercedes are a super-team; Ferrari are in upheaval and struggling for form. Yes, but success in sport is often cyclical. Ferrari are fabulously well-resourced. And who knows whether the team that Ross Brawn built at Mercedes will thrive so dominantly in the long run? Will Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe work harmoniously if the wheels fall off? How will Niki Lauda’s scattergun style of chairmanship play out? If Hamilton wants to be bold and take the plunge, he has a big ally at Ferrari. I hear from unimpeachable sources that the Scuderia’s president, Sergio Marchionne, rates Hamilton top of the drivers available to him. Vettel won four consecutive world championships as Red Bull dominated Formula One . It seems journalism is not a crime, Max Mosley . I hope it won’t spoil our next very agreeable lunch if I point out to Max Mosley that it has emerged from the Old Bailey that journalism is not a criminal offence, after all. For, in a blow to the former FIA president's censorship-seeking pressure group Hacked Off, four Sun journalists were cleared last week of paying public officials for stories in a case that delved far into the ethics of the tabloid Press. My trade's hero of the court is Mr Justice Saunders for his reaction to the prosecution’s haughty counsel, Mr Michael Parroy QC, who implied that the Sun’s chief reporter, John Kay, was wrong to describe the death in Afghanistan of Prince William’s Army mentor as ‘a belting exclusive splash’. The judge said: ‘The mere fact of it being a tragedy does not stop it being a good story.’ Jules Bianchi suffered a horrific crash at the Japanese Grand Prix in October last year . This reminded me of a furore after Jules Bianchi’s awful accident in Suzuka last year. Several bloggers – some of whom, we note, have never remotely held down a staff job at a blue chip media organisation – fulminated piously on their websites about the supposed insensitivity of at least one of my Fleet Street colleagues in seeking facts and answers from Bianchi’s Marussia team and the FIA in those worrying hours immediately after the crash. The critics did not understand that when a sports event immediately becomes a news inferno, the reporter must adapt. It was not insensitivity that led journalists to ask detailed questions of those whose job it was to answer them; it was a professional requirement. I shall stop being sanctimonious myself, now. But if anyone doubts the sense of what I say, I cite Mr Justice Saunders. Former FIA president Max Mosley arrives the High Court in London for the Leveson Inquiry . It's a shame to lose the German Grand Prix . It is bad enough being a Pommie visitor Down Under when the Australian team are blazing their way towards cricket's World Cup final and the boys who briefly masqueraded as the England team are already back and badly bruised in Blighty. But it is not only born and bred Aussies to be dodged. There was also the Pakistani-supporting taxi driver in Melbourne, who dissected England’s failings, brought me up to date with Imran Khan’s latest political plans and was about to fly next morning to Adelaide to watch his Pakistan team lose, as it predictably turned out, to Australia. Then you go to Sydney and are driven back from Watsons Bay by a Bangladeshi taxi driver. He hoots with laughter at how his heroes gave our lot a national disgrace of a caning. England were dumped out of the World Cup after a defeat by Bangladesh earlier this month . But it was still a rare thrill to go to the giant bowl of the MCG to watch one of the 49 days of cricket in this absurdly protracted competition. Sitting in the members’ area, we could visit the library, sip refreshments in reasonable comfort and gawp at the galleries of pictures of heroes like Douglas Jardine, who, as captain of the 1932-33 ‘Bodyline’ team, led the most notorious touring party to these shores since the First Fleet. A few hours after returning from the MCG it was announced that the German Grand Prix was off. Like most Formula One devotees, I was sorry. This is a heritage race. But could either German venue, the Nurburgring or Hockenheim, claim that they offered a world-class experience for punters or the travelling Formula One family? Hamilton drives his Mercedes to third in last season's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim . F1 is missing the voice of Murray Walker . Australian television sport is said to be a tough and jealous business. Especially so if you sound as English as Eddie Redmayne. But a few of our chaps have really cracked it: Henry Blofeld and Mark Nicholas, both from cricket, and, spectacularly, Murray Walker. Murray’s friend and successor, James Allen, told me once that by his reckoning only Sir Jack Brabham and, possibly, Alan Jones stood higher in the esteem of Australian motor-racing than our own high-decibel warbler. Reflecting on the dissatisfied response to the first race of the season in Melbourne, I wondered how different perceptions among TV viewers would have been if Murray had been behind the microphone rather than watching, headphones on, from the study of his Hampshire home. The famous F1 commentator Murray Walker had the ability doubled the excitement levels just by being there . For all the blanket coverage provided by Sky’s pioneering crack team, and the BBC’s excellent professional output, there is no longer that one voice which doubles the excitement levels just by being there. Transcendent commentators come along in any sport once in a generation, if we are lucky. David Coleman was one such golden larynx in athletics, a sport that has lost a little of its allure since he left it. Murray Walker, on two continents, was another."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lewis Hamilton's current Mercedes deal expires at the end of this season .\nMercedes say a new contract for the world champion is a formality .\nHamilton says he wants to extend his stay, so why the delay?\nHopefully the 30-year-old is holding out for a move to Ferrari .\nHamilton could finally prove that he is a better driver than Sebastian Vettel .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest news from the world of Formula One ."}]}

Coaching is a vocation, an all-consuming passion; not something to dabble at in the hope of discovering you possess a magical gift. Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson have devoted their lives to it. Many top players from the previous generation were chewed up and spat out having been through the usual routine: use your name to get a job, discover it’s damn hard and totally different to being a player and either get disillusioned or sacked or both. Soon the name doesn’t open doors because you’re no longer a star footballer but a failed manager. In the Championship, managers survive an average of eight months, not even long enough to complete the UEFA Pro Licence course, the top qualification which is required to coach in the top two tiers of English football. Gary Neville is one of a few former England internationals involved in coaching after stopping playing . Jamie Redknapp (left) and Jamie Carragher right) chose to work as pundits upon ending their playing days . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is one of a number of  Dutch professionals who have gone on to coach . It is a staggering statistic but out of the 92 Football League managers, only four have played for England and they have just 25 caps between them. They are Sheffield United’s Nigel Clough (14 caps), Huddersfield’s Chris Powell (5), Aston Villa’s Tim Sherwood (3) and Carlisle’s Keith Curle (3). Here lies the mangled logic at the heart of the problem. In the spirit of the football culture in this country, many good players are impatient, convinced they should bypass the qualification process. They would rather learn on the job but the job is too insecure on which to learn. Time in charge is diminishing, as is the likelihood of a second chance. Little wonder English coaching has become a punchbag for the failing national team, although English coaches actually do nothing much different to their foreign counterparts. Did we not like it when Holland beat England in Rotterdam in October 1993? Look back on the teams and none of Graham Taylor’s players are working full-time in football, although most have tried and some may return. Paul Ince managed for 238 games. Almost all the Dutch side are locked into the game at different levels. Six of them have the Pro Licence, compared with three of the English. Frank de Boer is coach of Ajax and has won the Dutch league four times in as many seasons . Danny Blind (left) is part of Holland's coaching setup and is earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink (centre) Former Arsenal winger Marc Overmars (right) is now the director of football at Ajax . Ronald Koeman is at Southampton and coveted by Barcelona, Frank de Boer is at Ajax, where Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp are in senior roles. Ronald de Boer was involved in the Ajax youth set-up until the club ordered him to choose between his coaching and broadcasting. He chose TV, surprisingly. Move on to the Euro 96 meeting between the nations and the Dutch team includes PSV Eindhoven boss Phillip Cocu and Danny Blind, earmarked to succeed Guus Hiddink as Holland coach. With Giovanni van Bronckhorst stepping up to become Feyenoord boss next season, it means Holland’s ‘Big Three’ clubs will be led by legends with more than 300 caps between them. There is nothing comparable in this country. Scour 92 clubs and you can find 25 England caps, property of Tim Sherwood (3), Keith Curle (3), Chris Powell (5) and Nigel Clough (14). There is a better show from some of the other Home Nations. In Terry Venables’ Euro 96 team which beat Holland 4-1, there was Gareth Southgate, now England U21 manager, protected in the confines of the FA bubble where Stuart Pearce spent much of his coaching career and where Gary Neville is learning. There was Teddy Sheringham, part-time at West Ham, and also in the squad were Les Ferdinand, QPR’s director of football, and Steve Stone, coach at Newcastle. Nothing proves elite players make the best coaches. The opposite could be true to some extent when you look at Ferguson, Wenger or Mourinho. But international players can make fine coaches as Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Bobby Robson, Don Howe and Venables proved. Some who have devoted much time to this subject conclude that the trend is rooted in the British culture, where academic teaching has always held sway over sporting education and where youth coaching is not treated as a career in itself — unlike in parts of Europe and the Americas. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell is one of four former England internationals in the Football League . Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood played three times for England but now manages in the Premier League . The opening of St George's Park has boosted the facilities on hand to the England national team . Why would millionaire footballers trade their comfortable lives to start at the bottom of a profession struggling for identity? This friction has lingered since the days of Sir Walter Winterbottom, who met resistance from traditionalists running clubs and the FA when he tried to modernise the England team to keep pace with countries such as Hungary and Italy in the ’50s. Barriers have been removed. The opening of St George’s Park and recent changes to coach education at the FA represent a big step forward according to many, but some views are deeply engrained. Winterbottom once asked Robson, one of his England players, what he might do when he finished playing. ‘I don’t know,’ replied Robson. ‘I don’t think cleaning windows is an option.’ Nor was a job on Sky Sports, so Winterbottom persuaded Robson to attend one of his coaching courses. Imagine Sven Goran Eriksson asking David Beckham the same question. ‘I’m going to help banish child poverty, model underpants and buy a franchise for a soccer team in Florida, Sven.’ How do the Dutch get their players into the coaching system? And how do they stay there when so many of the English slide out? Is it because England is a nation which prefers coaches to have come through the system? Quite the opposite, really. The obsession with rushing big-name players into high-profile jobs was more probably part of the problem. They weren’t ready for it, since they had no coaching experience, and have fallen out of the system, no doubt bruised by those who sit in judgment and brand them coaching failures. Swansea manager Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager, his team eighth in the Premier League . Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, is the highest ranked British coach in fifth . Meanwhile, there are brilliant coaches who have spent their lives in the lower leagues, a welcoming hand never reaching out to them from the Premier League. Many of the ’93 Holland team went through the Ajax gateway to a coaching career, a club with a reputation for producing elite talent. They were not thrown in at Wycombe like Tony Adams or at Stockport like Carlton Palmer. Holland is a hot-house football environment. Fewer professional teams mean it has a more concentrated focus of talent in competition. There is a greater tactical education and a desire to exchange ideas, all of which works for both young players and young coaches. Swansea’s Garry Monk is the top-ranked English manager in this country whose team are eighth in the Premier League. Of nine English managers in the top flight, five are in the bottom six fighting to prove their worth as the foreign coaches contest the title with Brendan Rodgers, the top-ranked Brit offering hope in fifth. Mauricio Pochettino has already managed Southampton and Tottenham at the age of 43 . Burnley manager Sean Dyche (left) and Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe are both highly rated British coaches . Should anyone slip, there is a ready supply of experienced and fully qualified foreign coaches, often ex-internationals, waiting to step in. Ambitious coaches such as Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino regularly jump ahead of promising homespun talent such as Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe. England, meanwhile, are in danger of surrendering an entire generation of international footballers to an array of media opportunities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 1993, Holland beat England 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier .\nMany of the England internationals from that night are now working in punditry .\nOn the Holland side however, most players are now working in coaching .\nOnly four former England players are now managing across the top four leagues ."}]}

England must win both matches, against lower-ranked opponents, to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage. An early exit looms large after Sunday's nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in Wellington followed wide-margin beatings by co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Joe Root has insisted that England must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games . Root snicks a ball down fine leg during England's defeat by Sri Lanka in their previous World Cup match . That has piled the pressure on, albeit in two games Root points out that England would have needed to win in any circumstance. 'If you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them,' Root said. 'The way our schedule is, we have these games towards the end. If it was broken up a bit more it might look slightly different. 'But it doesn't take away from the fact that we want to win these two games convincingly.' England's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last-eight they will now most likely play the highest-ranked team in Pool B. That will almost certainly be either South Africa or world champions India, who England did beat twice during the Tri-Series leading up to the World Cup. 'We don't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we've got wrong so far,' Root added. England captain Eoin Morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the World Cup . Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket wi . 'We know that if we get through to the quarter-finals we'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose. 'There will be sides coming up against us who could potentially be quite timid and think they should beat us and that could work in our favour. 'By the time you get to that stage it's crunch time and every side is under pressure; not just us. Hopefully we can get those wins and build some momentum.' Root believes the gap between England and the best teams at the World Cup is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest. 'I don't think that's fair,' he said. 'Yes, we have been beaten heavily in those three games, but I don't think that we are that far away from beating those sides. 'If we get the best out of every individual and all play as well as we can then we are just as good as sides like that if not better. It's about making sure, for the next two games especially, that we turn up and do everything we possibly can to put those performances in. 'That's got to come from the individuals to make sure they front up. Not just the senior players; not just exciting young players coming into the side. From everyone.' Root hit a career-best 121 from 108 balls against Sri Lanka but England's bowlers couldn't match his exploits . Steven Finn and James Taylor show their disappointment after England's third loss of the tournament . Root stood up to be counted in the Sri Lanka defeat when the 24-year-old became England's young World Cup centurion. His career-best 121 from 108 balls inspired England to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara eased Sri Lanka to victory in 16 balls. 'At the start of the day, if you'd given us 310 we'd have thought that a very good effort,' Root said. 'Whenever you get 310 on the board you are immediately putting sides under pressure to chase it. Unfortunately we didn't create that pressure with the ball and we didn't do anything to make it difficult for them from 10 overs onwards.' The ease of Sri Lanka's chase suggested England did not set their sights high enough and, while Root admitted more risks can be taken with the bat, they had left Sri Lanka with a record chase at the ground. 'There was no feeling turning up to the game that 270 was a par score,' he said. 'We got out there, we played it as we saw it, there were periods when Sri Lanka bowled really well at us. We got 310 which, on that wicket, I felt was a good score. 'In one-day cricket maybe we could have taken a few more risks, potentially we could have gone a bit earlier at them, be more aggressive earlier. But it's a fine balance. If you then lose two wickets - on that wicket, we'd done well to get to where we were. 'Unfortunately we couldn't quite create the pressure with the ball that they did. We weren't disciplined enough and we leaked too many boundaries.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "England have lost heavily to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka .\nJoe Root says they have to impress against Bangladesh and Afghanistan .\nThey must beat both to have chance of reaching World Cup quarter-finals ."}]}

Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food. 'We are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we can't direct funding away from them.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alex and Coral Pouros  paid £30 to take son Elliot to Wingham Wildlife Park .\nPacked dairy and soya free lunch for him and planned to buy theirs at cafe .\nStaff refused to allow the toddler to sit in restaurant and eat his own food .\nThe furious family left the zoo after just two hours vowing never to return ."}]}
