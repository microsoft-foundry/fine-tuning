        "- Base models struggled with user‑identity resolution and tool chaining.\n",
        "- Even strong models made mistakes in multi‑step reasoning (find_user → get_user_details).\n",

        "- Microsoft Foundry for model customization  \n",

        "\n",
        "#### **3. Generated high‑quality synthetic data**\n",
