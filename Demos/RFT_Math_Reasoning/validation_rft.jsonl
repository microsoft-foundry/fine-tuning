Therefore, she decided to go to one psychoanalyst and after a course of treatment, she got rid of half of her complexes and half of one of the remaining complexes. Then she went to another psychoanalyst, thanks to which she got rid of half of the remaining complexes and half of one of the still remaining complexes. The result of her visit to the third psychoanalyst was exactly the same.
